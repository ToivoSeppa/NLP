This is my thesis work on NLP-analysis of web scraped reviews. The web scraper scrapes reviews from Trustpilot and converts them to a pandas dataframe. 
The reviews data include titles, body text, rating, location and date.
In the analysis NLP is used to find the most common bigrams in both positive and negative reviews.
