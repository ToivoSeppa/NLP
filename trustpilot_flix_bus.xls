People wanted to know if that bus was the correct one and he kept saying that he could not provide that information and kept screaming to get their tickets out. Then you go in and surprise there is no AC. On a 6 hour drive through the desert. Also there is no WiFi or at least it never showed up and again staff refused to answer questions but were happy to let everyone know that they would leave them on the stop if they weren‚Äôt there at a NON SPECIFIC TIME!

I came from orlando to Atlanta,"Horrible experience. Absolutely unhelpful and careless staff. So here's the story: I booked my trip as a ""fun ride"" with my son. I don't travel with bus and just wanted to enjoy the panoramic view and a have nice trip. I paid extra fee for the front panorama seats to fullfil the kids wish. I had a hotel booked and paid for in the destination. On the way getting to the station we missed our connection to get there on time, so I grab my e-scooter in order to catch the bus. We arrived on time and we just get ""Im not taking you with the scooter"" from the driver. ""It's in T&C, not my problem"", enters the bus and drives away in front of our eyes. After the crying is over, we go to the ticket office if we can get another connection (we would keep the scooter in the luggage storage), or at least a refund. ""No sorry, can't do anything. Go and fill a form on the web"". So I go to the web, of course the form is well hidden, so I contact the support there. ""It's in the T&C, your problem"". My fault? Apparently yes, guess I should have read the tiny fine print (definitely wasn't obvious anywhere at the time of the booking). Any helpfulness, compassion, understanding though? Not at all.

Horrible experience,I made a mistake when changing the time on my ticket and called customer service to help rectify the issue but they were no help and suggested I pay the $42 again to adjust the time by a half hour.

Flix wanted me to pay $84 in time corrections for a $37 ticket ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS! If the company needs to save money get rid of the useless customer service department.

After mutiple calls to their customer care ( who on record accept that it's a big mess) they have not actioned on returning my luggage.

Bus was comfortable,"ZERO STARSThat trip from Lethbridge to Edmonton I will never forget.  The driver was extremely, unbelievably rude and I have witnesses to prove it.  In Lethbridge I knocked on the door to check if the bus was the one to Edmonton.  The driver opened the door and started yelling at me that he was on a break.  He wasted more time yelling than he would have had answering my question.  Then he tried to close the automatic bus door while I was standing there.  The door hit me and hurt my back (the pain did not go away).  Tomorrow, I am going to see my doctor.  If there is indeed injury, I will call my lawyer.  I am serious.  I have two witnesses to attest to the above statement; they were scandalised by driver's behaviour.In Edmonton, I had to drag my heavy bag from the luggage compartment by getting inside it, as the bag was pushed very deep towards the middle of the bus.  Not only did the driver not help me (I have very limited ability to use my right hand), he laughed loudly when I hit my head against compartment's lifted door.  It was so rude, unprofessional, inconsiderate that the person whom I accompanied on the trip as a guide, a distinguished artist from Europe, said that we should leave the station as soon as possible because she ""could not stand that absolutely rude driver"".  When I told the driver that I'd contact FlixBus about these incidents, he laughed and mockingly said ""Go ahead, call them!"".Throughout the trip, the driver was very unpleasant to several other people, he often raised his voice.  In general, he represented your company in the worst possible way.

Great comfortable experience,"We had a terrible experience on our return trip from Amsterdam Sloterdijk to Paris Bercy Seine. After we lost our luggage in one of their buses, Flixbus's customer service has been more unhelpful than I thought was possible.Basically, when leaving from Sloterdijk station in Amsterdam, there were two Flixbus buses going to Paris within 15 minutes of each other. They were parked next to each other. One was the 800 bus and the other (which we had booked for) was the X800. We put our bag on the 800 bus - seeing the destination and what we thought was the correct number. The 800 left 15 minutes earlier than the X800 and took our luggage with it. In a panic, we went to the Flixbus booth at the station to try get help from the agent there. He wasn't helpful, did not offer to get in touch with the driver or the Paris station and told us to just report our lost luggage on the website. We then tried using the online chat to explain our story and try get in touch with the driver but again we were told to report our lost luggage using the online form. All this despite the fact that we knew where our luggage was and that we would be arriving at the same station!So we reported our lost luggage and hoped that we would arrive at Paris and be able to grab our bag there. It was an incredibly stressful journey.Unfortunately, there was traffic driving into Paris and we arrived about 30 minutes after the 800 bus. By the time we arrived, our bags were probably sitting in a bus somewhere at the station but the driver was nowhere to be seen. We tried to explain our situation to a Flixbus employee we saw in the parking lot and he said there was nothing he could do and we would have to go through the lost luggage procedure. We also waited an hour in the line at the ticket office to chat to the Flixbus agent there. He tried to help us but didn't have access to get the registration number of the 800 bus where our luggage was. It was the first time someone actually tried to help.The absolute lack of common sense we saw from Flixbus employees as well as the bureaucracy of the lost luggage process is a joke. We now have to wait for two weeks and hope that they get back to us with our luggage. The whole process is opaque with no updates.  I don't have high hopes but even if we get our luggage back, this experience has been overwhelmingly negative.Wifi was fine. Drivers were nice. Bus smelled like urine on our first leg to Paris.

Comodidade na viagem,"An Unsafe and Unprofessional Experience with FlixBus - Never AgainI recently traveled with FlixBus from Hannover to Amsterdam, and it was by far the most disappointing and concerning experience I have ever had with a transportation service. I urge anyone considering this company to seriously reconsider due to the carelessness and unprofessionalism of their drivers, which put all passengers at risk.To start, the bus arrived 1 hour and 30 minutes late with no communication or updates about the delay. This lack of organization and customer service set a negative tone from the beginning, and things only went downhill from there.An hour into the trip, the bus shockingly collided with a stationary car on the highway. This was no minor incident‚Äîit took over two hours to resolve the situation, all while passengers were left waiting with no clear information. The situation was mishandled at every turn, showcasing a complete lack of preparedness and professionalism by FlixBus.The situation only worsened when a new driver took over. This driver, visibly angry, drove aggressively, speeding and disregarding passenger comfort. His attitude toward passengers was openly hostile, creating a tense and uncomfortable atmosphere. This reckless behavior added yet another layer of danger to an already hazardous journey.Overall, this journey with FlixBus was unacceptable on multiple levels. The company‚Äôs disregard for passenger safety, the lack of professional conduct from its drivers, and the utter lack of transparency left me and others feeling vulnerable and uneasy. Based on this experience, I strongly recommend avoiding FlixBus for your travel needs.

"Confort, price","I rarely write reviews, but this situation deserves it. Yesterday, I had a scheduled trip from New York with a departure at 3:45 p.m. We boarded the bus right at that time, and half an hour later, we were informed that it was canceled due to a technical problem. They told us we would be reassigned to another bus, but they didn‚Äôt provide any further explanations.At 4:15 p.m., we received an email informing us that we had to catch a new bus at 5 p.m., but from another station 5 km away. We had to run with our luggage those 5 km across the city and arrived just 2 minutes before the new bus departed. Furthermore, the new route took longer, so we arrived 2 hours late at our destination.We contacted Flixbus to express our dissatisfaction, and their response was that since we made it to the bus, the service was considered complete, and there was nothing more to say. I don't know how the service is with other companies, but it's clear that Flixbus doesn't care about the well-being of its passengers. I strongly recommend trying other options.",5,BG,2024-10-21,Trustpilot
Sa√≠da e chegada no hor√°rio estipulado,"Update: note Flixbus's snarky response to my review:""We can confirm that the case resolution was in accordance to our Terms and Conditions, which you agreed to upon booking the ticket.""To which I have this to say: DO NOT travel with Flixbus. If they cancel a bus at the last minute, you'll be left with no options other than a cancellation. Paid a lot of money or spent a lot of time commuting to the departure terminal? Tough! Flixbus doesn't care. They think rebooking you on another bus hours later is sufficient to make up for the inconvenience. And when you complain, they'll simply tell you to suck it up. If you MUST travel with Flixbus for whatever reason, be prepared for the worst and allow time for getting screwed over by the bus line.Hey, Flixbus customer service: thanks for your complete lack of understanding! You're the worst! ----Bus was cancelled after I arrived at the departure station. Was rebooked on a later bus but customer service was unsympathetic about the inconvenience this caused me. No phone support. I had to commute to the station via public transit, and a phone call letting me know about the cancellation would have saved me three hours of standing around doing nothing. Bus was dirty and other passengers didn‚Äôt respect the seat reservations. I had paid for a specific seat that was unavailable on the rebooked bus, and getting a refund took a lot of effort.

reliable transportation on time‚Ä¶,"Les bus FlixBus sont √† des boites de prestataires. Certains prestataires sont vraiment √† la hauteur, d‚Äôautres beaucoup moins. L‚Äôambiance dans un bus d√©pend beaucoup des personnes qui composent ce bus. Les chauffeurs d‚ÄôEurope de l‚ÄôEst sont les meilleurs : ils font leur m√©tier avec beaucoup de professionnalisme et d‚Äôattention pour leurs passagers. Par contre, il peut arriver que vous tombiez dans un bus pleins d'√©trangers qui n‚Äôont pas les m√™mes normes que nous dans le respect des autres (enl√®ve leurs chaussures, te bousculent √† chaque fois qu‚Äôils passent dans l‚Äôall√©e centrale, ne mettent pas leurs √©couteurs, te colle, ‚Ä¶, et je remarque malheureusement que leur hygi√®ne corporelle est vraiment horrible‚Ä¶ apr√®s ils sont peu √™tre tous en train immigrer ce qui explique leur odeur compliqu√©e).

Aussi, √©viter de prendre une correspondance SNCF sous peine de possiblement la manquer. Les prix en revanche d√©fient toute concurrence.

Sali√≥ un poco atrasado ,"Ist das erste Mal, dass ich mit dem Flixbus gefahren bin. Ich Liste es genauso wie ich es sonst auch mache, in Pro und Contra auf:Pro:- Die Busse sind einigerma√üen p√ºnktlich, Versp√§tungen werden gut aufgeholt.- Versp√§tungen, die durch Fahrg√§ste verursacht werden, werden mit einer Strafe von 6‚Ç¨ direkt Sanktioniert. Dies schreckt Reisende davon ab, die Pausen zu √ºberziehen.- Es wird beim Einladen von Gep√§ck geholfen- Busse sind sauber und gem√ºtlich- Steckdose + entweder 2x USB Oder 1x USB/1x USB-C (kein Schnelladen) pro 2er Sitz. WLAN vorhanden, in 2 von 4 Bussen nicht nutzbar, da die Login Seite nicht funktionierte.- Toilette in jeden Bus vorhanden, diese sind aber sehr klein. Empfehlung: Desinfektion Spray f√ºr die H√§nde mitnehmen und aufs H√§ndewaschen im Klo verzichten.- Gute Auskunft- G√ºnstige TicketpreiseContra:- Es wird nie auf die Anschnallpflicht hingewiesen, kaum einer hat sich angeschnallt.- Die Busse warten auf Fahrg√§ste, die zu sp√§t sind. - Leider bei der R√ºcktour einen Fahrgast gehabt, der extrem gestunken hat.- Busfahrer konnten auf meinen Touren alle kein Deutsch, Englisch Kenntnisse sind daher bei Fragen Vorraussetzung.- Das GPS Tracking funktioniert unzureichend.- Man bekommt bei Versp√§tungen viel zu sp√§t Bescheid gegeben.Allen in Allen ein gutes Mittelma√ü. Auf jeden Fall angenehmer mit FlixBus zu reisen als mit der deutschen Bummelbahn.Anmerkung: Plant lieber mehr Umsteigezeit ein, falls man auf die Bahn oder √ñPNV umsteigen muss.

Very quick and easy,"First time using Flixbus, from London to Spain. The bus left an hour late, nobody was notified of this beforehand. The first problem was with the seating. I reserved a seat, however, the driver stated, this was not possible and that everyone could sit wherever they liked. The driver left 8 of us in Calais as he drove off the ferry without doing a headcount, or waiting, even though we were not late back to the bus. The staff at Calais ferry terminal said this was a frequent occurrence with Flixbus. Stranded in Calais, customer service for Flixbus were extremely unhelpful and stated we were all late back to get on the bus and there was nothing they could do. They stated we could find our own way to the next transfer point, at our own expense. I travelled independently to the next transfer point after waiting for Flixbus to rectify the situation, however after 2 hours, it was evident they were not going to help. I met my transfer in Paris, continued my journey and finally arrived at my destination. The buses on the trip were cramped and not comfortable for such a long trip. The transfers to another bus on route were too frequent and the average transfer time was 2 hours, one part of the journey is a 5 hour wait time to board the next bus. The return journey was better, although, the first bus left early, the transfers were still frequent and long. The bus missed our ferry and we were advised by the driver to sleep for four hours while waiting to board the next one! Flixbus would not accept responsibility for this and refused to refund additional costs that were incurred by having to pay for another ticket as I was not able to make my transfer and had already paid for a ticket. Overall, not a great service experience. Cheap travel is the good thing, although once you buy your ticket, you soon realise you are just an inconvenience to the drivers and are not treated with much respect. I will not be using their service again. ",5,PT,2024-10-19,Trustpilot

Hun ble fulgt til bussen av sin bror, da hun har en lettere utviklingshemming. Sj√•f√∏r mente hun ikke hadde betalt for billett, men kun kj√∏pt bagasje. Hennes bror kunne vise billett, men sj√•f√∏r var standhaftig og nektet for at det var betalt for henne. Hun gikk inn p√• bussen, fant sete mens sj√•f√∏r og hennes bror diskuterte. Det endte med at sj√•f√∏r lukker d√∏ren og kj√∏rer. Jeg g√•r til den reisende kvinnen for √• se om hun har det bra. Hun sitter √• gr√•ter. Jeg tror da at hun sitter p√• sin plass, og at hun har sete til Kristiansand. N√•r sj√•f√∏ren kj√∏rer fortsetter han √• diskutere h√∏ylytt med andre passasjerer som reagerer p√• hans oppf√∏rsel. Han blir enda mer aggressiv og h√∏ylytt. Plutselig sier han at kvinnen vil bli satt av p√• busstopp i Drammen. Jeg henvender meg til sj√•f√∏ren og sier at det ikke er mulig. Hun kan ikke bli satt av bussen alene, og vente en time p√• neste buss. Jeg sp√∏r sj√•f√∏r om jeg kan sitte p√• klapp-sete fremme ved sj√•f√∏r, s√• kvinnen f√•r bli med hele veien til Kristiansand. Det sier han ja til. En av de andre passasjerene tilbyr seg √• sitte der, s√• jeg kan sitte ved siden av kvinnen som er veldig ute av seg over hele situasjonen. Under veis krangler  som nevn sj√•f√∏ren h√∏ylytt med andre passasjerer, han tar mange ganger, mens han kj√∏rere frem mobilen for √• vise andre passasjerer oversikt over at bussen er full. I tillegg bruker han flere ganger mobil uten handsfree.Jeg har v√¶rt i kontakt med kundeservice. De kunne bekrefte til meg at det IKKE er mulig √• kj√∏pe billett til kun bagasje. Man M√Ö ikke betale for sete, hvis man ikke √∏nsker et spesielt sete. Hvis man ikke betaler for sete vil man f√• tildelt et setenummer p√• billetten. St√•r det ikke setenummer p√• billetten, skal ledige seter v√¶re merket med gr√∏nne lapper. Sj√•f√∏ren kjenner tydeligvis ikke til rutinene til selskapet han kj√∏rer med. Skremmende √• oppleve en s√• aggressiv sj√•f√∏r som det ikke er mulig √• f√∏re en dialog med. Beklager, men han burde ikke v√¶re sj√•f√∏r, og ha ansvar for passasjerenes sikkerhet.

I‚Äôm sure many customers use the service for regular commuting as it calls at the airport for collection before heading to Sweden. But there were many, like me, who make the journey to experience crossing the famous √òresund bridge. I‚Äôm sure the company know this yet on both crossings the windscreen clearly hadn‚Äôt been cleaned for many days spoiling the view. Furthermore, I (again like many I‚Äôm sure) used YouTube videos to ascertain where the collection points were. Sadly these videos are misleading as they are out of date. This led to asking local people and others for directions. It is possible to get this information on the FlixBus website but only if you Track your Journey. Surely the company should automatically send detailed information once tickets are secured? For us, the outbound journey was from a newly constructed bus terminal further away from where it used to be. It looks like when the signage systems are up and running, FlixBus will be a major user of this terminal. The return journey started at a multi laned bus terminal with no signage at all and it was over 600m from the Hyllie station named on the ticket. All this caused much stress.

Very good experience,"I usually avoid long distance buses like the plague, but this seemed to be the only option for getting from Ljubljana to Italy so I decided to go as far as Trieste and get the train onward.

Well what happens is you get stopped at the Italian border for over an hour, the police storm the bus and take your passports, with no indication of when you‚Äôll see the passports again. Zero communication from the bus staff who just used it as a smoking break, meanwhile I miss my onward train and waste a day. So much for Schengen. If they know about these border delays why do they not warn about it anywhere on their website or in emails. They‚Äôve been spamming me telling me that USB sockets and toilets are out of order, but not the way more important thing that I might never get to my destination.

This made my son concerned for his bus coming home as he was lucky and his original bus did come. However, on his way home, his bus was delayed. The notification came when the bus was supposed to be at the gate already. Obviously the bus carrier already knew the bus would be late but they did not advise the riders until the moment that their bus was to be there. It was over an hour and a half late, and he might have missed it as the carrier did not update the app with information about a gate change. Thankfully the bus terminal staff let people know. When I messaged Flix Bus about information on where the incoming bus was coming from, I received a ridiculous explanation how they could not advise this for privacy issues. Seriously, privacy?

After waiting for more than 20 minutes (because when our daughter had last taken flix the bus had been 20 minutes late) we called Flix customer service and found out that indeed that was our bus. If Flix is going to use some other bus service, the least they could do would be to put some signs in their windows. This caused me to have to scramble and pay a lot more money to get on Amtrak in order to not miss my appointment in New York City. ",4,DK,2024-10-16,Trustpilot

It was convenient and easy.,"It was a very unpleasant experience. The driver was late, although it was written on the station board that he would be on time. The departure was supposed to be at 8:10 —Ä.m., in the recommendations to arrive in 15 minutes. The bus arrived at 8:10 —Ä.m. Therefore, all this time I and other passengers were running around the station –êmsterdam, looking for that bus and constantly checking the board, which did not change the inscription that the bus would be late. when the bus arrived and everyone ran up, the driver never once said that it was the bus of this flight and did not even comment on his tardiness. Instead, he closed the bus and went somewhere. When he turned and began to sit on the other door, everyone guessed again, but he did not say to go. it was raining outside, and he opened the luggage compartment and did not check tickets and let passengers go, but chatted for a few minutes with some man on unknown topics. The bus itself was not in good condition - the armrests on my seat were broken. the road monitoring monitor did not turn on. The driver did not report the trip, stopped at the gas station and did not say anything. We were late to our destination - again the driver did not say anything or warn us about it",5,GB,2024-10-16,Trustpilot
The bus service is very professional,The bus driver was very rude and impolite.. I believe he did not want to allow me to have the ride as i was the only brown guy trying to board the bus.. I showed him my ticket including qr code but he refused to accept  as well as refused to check my name on the list.. truly it was obvious he was showing his racial attitude to me and he did not want me to board his bus. I went and complained to the manager who said I can either convert my ticket to the 2.45 pm bus or buy another ticket for 10.30.. Since it was cold and raining I did not want to wait till 2.45 and booked 10.30 bus. at 11:00 AM I was informed 10.30 bus has been cancelled .. I had to return to the airport train station and board two trains to get to my destination because of this rude driver of Flix bus 09:15AM from Amsterdam to Brugges.. I have been to more than 25 countries and used buses there..nowhere else i have had to interact with such a rude racist driver..I regret very much on choosing flix bus now,4,UA,2024-10-16,Trustpilot
Courteous and very helpful driver and‚Ä¶,"I have used Flixbus multiple times. To and from different places. The first time I used a coach, I travelled from Leicester to Newcastle with a friend, which was a positive experience. Second time was a bit more entertaining, and the bus was like 2 hours delayed, and then we proceeded to get hit by a truck, which was entirely outside of the control of the coach, however the pulled over, took photos and 15 minutes later we were back on the motorway. They also double checked that all passengers were safe and not hurt. Luckily everyone was perfectly fine. I'm not using the bus again. And travelled from Liverpool to Sunderland with a pitt stop in Manchester. They were on time for both. Large interchange time allowing delays. And this time I travelled with crutches and they were kind when it came to bags etc etc.  I will be travelling to Liverpool as well. And they have all also been nothing but helpful.  Totally recommend. The bathroom situation is dodgy I stay away from it. However some bus drivers should show more empathy.  One Bus driver entirely ignored this guy throwing up in the back... and really some care should show. However most drivers have been kind and amazing.  Also after the 2 hour delay.

Good ride,"I‚Äôve used Flixbus a few times in the past and had positive experiences. This time the bus was more than 2 hours late. On October 12 evening I received an email at 6:25pm saying that the bus departing that night at 7:10pm from Dresden train station to Berlin airport was delayed 85minutes. After this there was no additional communication and the bus did not arrive until 9:37pm. This was much later than initially communicated and there was no information after the initial email to provide an update on the bus. All the customers had to sit outside in the cold at the bus stop for over an hour. There was an old man who was not very healthy at the bus stop, after standing outside for a time he fell over and other customers had to help lift him off the ground. It was possible to track the bus via the app but I didn‚Äôt have the ability to download at the time so luckily other travelers kept me updated, but it was extremely nerve-wracking because my flight departed next morning 6:15am so I needed to return to Berlin without fail. I‚Äôm glad the bus finally came but the communication needs to be improved going forward. ",5,DK,2024-10-15,Trustpilot
Great service,"Absolutely awful experience travelling from Gatwick to Bristol on Tuesday 8th of October. The aircon was blowing out hot air and there was no windows on the bus. It was showing as over 40 degrees and was becoming increasingly unbearable for myself as I‚Äôm 22 weeks pregnant, but also many other travellers. I began to feel faint and quite panicky from feeling claustrophobic. I went to speak with the driver to ask her to please stop the bus when it was safe to do so as I needed some air as I felt extremely faint. She was very rude and said that it wasn‚Äôt safe to stop, that everyone was hot and she wouldn‚Äôt stop until we reached Bristol. This then turned into an argument where she stopped the bus and threatened to call the police to throw me off! So she could stop the bus to do this but couldn‚Äôt stop the bus to give me air. She finally stopped at a service station an hour later and then refused to drive. Eventually about 55 mins later we all got back on the bus and continued on to Bristol in the same horrible conditions! When I contacted flix bus they said they wouldn‚Äôt refund me. I would never use their bus again or recommend them to anyone.",5,IT,2024-10-15,Trustpilot

Goed ticket pijs,"Unsere Erfahrung mit Flixbus war schlichtweg katastrophal. Nach einem gro√üartigen Tag auf dem Oktoberfest in M√ºnchen standen wir um 11 Uhr am Busbahnhof mit unseren Tickets und mussten zu unserem Entsetzen erfahren, dass unsere 10 Personen Fahrt storniert wurde. Der Grund? Ein Buswechsel, der unsere Tickets ung√ºltig machte.Das war besonders √§rgerlich, da f√ºnf von uns in systemrelevanten Berufen arbeiten und am n√§chsten Tag p√ºnktlich bei der Arbeit erscheinen mussten (die restlichen 5 opferten sich die Nacht am Bahnhof zu verbrigen). Verzweifelt versuchten wir also doch noch nach Hause zu kommen, und stellten fest, dass sechs Pl√§tze im Bus frei waren. Warum wurden unsere Tickets also storniert? Diese Frage blieb unbeantwortet und verst√§rkte unsere Verzweiflung.Nach langen Diskussionen bot uns der Busfahrer an, f√ºr ein zus√§tzliches Trinkgeld von 50 Euro pro Person mitfahren zu d√ºrfen. Auf die Bitte um eine Zahlungsbest√§tigung wurden wir unh√∂flich angefahren, mussten das Angebot jedoch akzeptieren, da wir nach Hause mussten. Leider hatten wir keine Beweise f√ºr diese ""Schwarzzahlung"", was eine Anzeige sinnlos machen w√ºrde ‚Äì auch wenn es dringend n√∂tig w√§re!Ich hoffe nun, dass Flixbus auf diesen Vorfall reagiert.!Es ist inakzeptabel, wie Kunden hier behandelt werden und welche Praktiken angewandt wurden. Die Fahrt von M√ºnchen nach Bozen am 03.10.2024 um 23:15 Uhr (Buchungsnummer 3187996364) war ein absolutes Desaster!",4,BA,2024-10-13,Trustpilot

Min s√∏n m√•tte efterf√∏lgende haste til K√∏benhavn men fik sin k√¶reste til at tage ind til Ingerslevsgade ved hovedbaneg√•rden for at tage imod bussen og hans baggage. Trods grundig s√∏gen og henvendelser til andre Flixbus chauff√∏rer og ansatte lykkedes det ikke at finde bussen??Ingen hj√¶lp at f√•, intet, blot skuldertr√¶k.

Udfyld formularen(/..(vi er ligeglade!?) Min s√∏n har aldrig h√∏rt fra eller modtaget noget efterf√∏lgende.

Clearly, FlixBus doesn‚Äôt care how their customers are treated.I‚Äôve used FlixBus multiple times in the past, but let‚Äôs be honest, the only reason I tolerated their poor service was the cheap price. The internet never works, the toilets are often out of service, and the buses themselves are filthy.

Good travel,"I took a bus that was meant to be going to NYC from Binghamton, NY. About 45 mins into the trip, I realized that the bus driver was driving in the wrong direction towards Ithaca, NY instead of to NYC. I asked another passenger to speak to the bus driver as I was concerned that I might be on the wrong bus. The bus driver confirmed we were going to NYC and then around ten minutes later, he turned around. Twenty minutes later, he admitted to us he had gone the wrong way. As a result of this error and additional traffic, we didn‚Äôt end up arriving in NYC until 4:15pm, over two hours later than our original arrival time of 1:55pm. I had a train connection I had to run to catch, and the only reason I was able to make it was because my train was delayed. I was so distressed that I briefly got on the wrong train to Illinois when I was meant to be going to Washington D.C. I understand that issues such as traffic cannot be controlled, but I felt I deserved some compensation for the very stressful journey brought about by an error on behalf of the bus driver. I just don‚Äôt understand how he could have gone completely in the wrong direction. When I contacted FlixBus with the details of the case, they said: ‚ÄúPlease be assured that we have checked your case, and after careful verification, we saw that the passengers registered on the ticket have been checked in therefore we are unable to offer you compensation in this case.‚Äù Clearly they don‚Äôt care about their customers.",5,US,2024-10-10,Trustpilot

I was assigned seat 20D on bus 403 from Verona Porta Nuova to Ljubljana and it turned out that there was another person also booked in that seat. The driver told me to sit in another seat that was free and so I did. Later another passenger came in and said that I was in her seat and started screaming at me and calling me all sorts of names! This is totally unacceptable! I paid to get from Italy to Slovenia not to play musical chair when a new passenger comes in and to be harassed! I had to spend over 5 hours listening to that other passenger screaming at me because I was now in her seat when I was supposed to be assigned a proper seat! I've been trying to get a refund from flixbus but they are refusing to refund me. Flixbus made the mistake of booking several people in one seat but they refuse to take any responsibility!! What kind of company are you running?? Do not travel with flixbus!Edit to add: They sent me an email admitting that they assigned several people the same seat and yet refused to refund me!

great service,"I had to cancel my trip today because the timetable alteration meant I would miss the connecting bus, and no sign of a refund.

An easy app to use ,"As I was planning the trip from Zadar to Dubrovnik, Croatia, I had to rely on reviews from other travelers as I had never used bus services overseas (I live in NY, USA). The most important or me was that I can make reservations. I booked two tickets for Friday, 27 Sep. 2024 at 5:30 am from Zadar to Dubrovnik, with transfer in Split.After boarding in Zadar, (Route N896 Flix Bus Direction Split) I felt there was no reason to worry. It went smooth, the driver was as courteous as it can be, drive fast and comfortable. But, all that changed in Split at the transfer First, at the ticket shelter they give us wrong platform number. When we noticed the bus is not showing up, we start checking other platforms, and yes, we found the bus for Dubrovnik.  The driver was standing in front of the entrance door to the bus, scanning passengers' tickets. Upon entering the bus, we noticed that our seats were taken, and the people did not respond to our comment that those seats were reserved. We went out to ask the driver to help us with seat reservation. He responded: ‚ÄúComplain to the company! I do not care if you are coming with me or not.‚Äù  Whatever I said, ‚Äúfell on deaf ears‚Äù.  I was completely ignored. He left, without any care in the world. I never ever thought it would even be possible for something like that to happen. Needless to say, I was furious. My trip was ruined. What I do not understand is how hard is to put a note on reserved seats so that people boarding up the bus can see the seats are left for someone who paid extra ticket for sitting there, especially when the bus is empty, just starting its route.",5,US,2024-10-09,Trustpilot

Easy and quick,"I booked a return trip from downtown Toronto to Niagara Falls, with my scheduled departure from Niagara Falls at 7:00 PM. I arrived at the station at 6:30 PM, but the bus did not arrive as expected. At 7:20 PM, a bus arrived, and the driver informed me that this was the 8:00 PM departure and that the 7:00 PM bus had been delayed. I continued to wait for the 7:00 PM bus until 7:45 PM, but it never arrived. I approached the driver of the 8:00 PM bus to inquire if I could board in case of available seats. Unfortunately, he declined and was quite rude and disrespectful, despite the fact that I was stranded. I was forced to purchase a new ticket for the 8:00 PM bus. What I found particularly unfair was that while I had to pay for a new ticket, the driver allowed most of the passengers from the delayed 7:00 PM bus to board the 8:00 PM bus without purchasing a new ticket. I am unsure why I was singled out and required to purchase a new ticket.Given this experience, I would strongly advise against using this company for time-sensitive trips, as their service is unreliable and inconsistent.",5,AR,2024-10-06,Trustpilot

On the Rijeka Zagreb line,"My traveling bag was missing upon arrival to the final destination, 28 Allen St, NY, NY 10002 from Bethesda, MD. As a passenger of Flixbus even in Europe, should it not be shocking to have such a devastating experience ??And the customer service has no clue of their corporate address in the USA. No business could operate without a government business permit. Therefore, it has people and places involved. Could the driver pay attention not only to passengers with tickets but to safe guard the luggages? There must be a way/system to prevent from losing or missing or stealing  personal property like passengers whose drop off are the same, their luggage‚Äôs should be placed in one compartment. The trip clearly indicated only one drop of, Allen. But it did in Midtown, leaving only 3 passengers in Allen. The Driver who gave his name, called out when stopping in Delaware. A call out, a warning to remaining passengers to take their luggages inside would be helpful when drop of in Midtown. This case remains unresolved so it should stay opened. My trip was paid, not a hitch ride. Passengers trusted FlixBus so do I.   The company has passengers‚Äô email addresses and could reach out to each one. I have my name and address inside my bag.

Because it wasnt cancelled.,"I want to bring to your attention a shocking incident involving Flixbus bus driver. Here are the details: The driver of bus number 2 - DJG - 446, a white Mercedes Tourismo, displayed shockingly rude, inadequate, and offensive behaviour. Despite having a valid ticket and arriving at the departure point well before the scheduled time, the driver denied boarding and refused to let me take the trip. To make matters worse, the driver addressed me and other passengers informally, hurled insults, and even physically pushed a fellow passenger out of the bus. This ordeal forced me to purchase another ticket, causing me to lose my money, and time and undergo severe stress.

Flixbus. The worst travel experience ever: shockingly rude driver behaviour,"I am very upset with Flixbus! I tried to purchase a ticket on Flixbus August 20th, but my Chase credit card was declined by Flixbus when it should have been approved because I have excellent credit. The online schedule showed a bus from Edmonton to Calgary, Canada at 11am, and at 2:15pm in the afternoon. But I could not book my ticket online because my credit card was declined, when it should not have been. I then walked 16 blocks to the bus itself because I was hoping the bus driver could book my ticket. I am an 85-year old senior who walks with a cane and has mobility issues -- so you can understand how challenging all this was for me. I then called Chase credit company to figure this out -- which was a 45-minute international call, at my expense, since I had to call from Canada to the United States. Chase told me my credit card was perfectly fine to make charges, but still Flix Bus declined. It was very frustrating.Then, to make matter even worse, a Flixbus representative told me to go to the ""waiting room"" for the 2:15 bus -- when there was no waiting room. Plus the bus driver could not book my ticket for the 2:15pm bus. Please inform your representatives that there is NO WAITING ROOM and to not tell potential customers inaccurate information.Fortunately we found the Red Arrow Bus Company who easily charged my credit card and I was able to get to my destination of Calgary.  I will never use Flixbus in USA or Canada! Thank god for the Red Arrow Bus! Sincerely, Darlene",1,BR,2024-10-01,Trustpilot

Puntualit√†‚Ä¶√® autobus nuovi,"Meine Erfahrung mit dem Unternehmen FlixBus ist die folgende, dass ich von FlixBus finanziell betrogen wurde. F√ºr den 03.08. haben ich und meine Schwester eine Reise von M√ºnchen nach Lviv, in die Ukraine, √ºber Katovitce bei Flixbus gebucht, Abreise um 21:50 Uhr von M√ºnchen. Wir warteten auf der Plattform, zu der Plattform ist kein Bus gekommen. Als ich die Hotline angerufen hatte, wurde mir von FlixBus-Mitarbeiterin mitgeteilt, dass meine Schwester bereits ""eingecheckt"" sei und sich in dem Bus befindet. Dabei war es ein v√∂lliger Unsinn, denn meine Schwester und ich standen in M√ºnchen auf derselben Plattform zusammen und es gab keinen Bus und auch nat√ºrlich kein Check-In von meiner Schwester. Die Mitarbeiterin von Flixbus-Hotline hat uns gesagt, wir sollen ein neues Ticket kaufen und das Geld f√ºr das Ersatzticket wird uns erstattet. Wir wollten einen Ersatz noch an demselben Tag bekommen, denn die Reise war dringend. Man hat uns da nicht geholfen und wir waren gezwungen, ein Ersatzticket zu kaufen. Nun erstattet Flixbus den Preis keiner dieser Tickets! Weder von der Fahrt wo ""meine Schwester sich mit ihrem Namen eingecheckt hat"" (Unglaublich!) noch von der Ersatzreise! Obwohl man auf dem Ersatzticket nachweislich sieht, dass die Abfahrt der Ersatzreise in M√ºnchen nur in wenigen Stunden stattgefunden hat. Das ist eine Schikane und ein reiner Kundenbetrug. Mit diesem Fall werde ich zur Verbraucherzentrale und zur Polizei in M√ºnchen gehen, um den finanziellen Schaden mir erstatten zu lassen. Aktuell wird mir nicht mal was von mir gefragt wurde, der Ticketpreis, erstattet.      ",5,US,2024-09-30,Trustpilot

Excellent service,"El pasado viernes 2 de agosto cog√≠ un Flixbus con una amiga desde Viena Central Station, direcci√≥n Budapest N√©pliget bus station, cuyo trayecto era de 23:45 a 1:45 (ruta 902). Una vez cruzada la frontera, el conductor hizo un desv√≠o en la autopista para parar en una estaci√≥n de servicio a la altura de¬†Mosonmagyar√≥v√°r. Nos comunic√≥ que realizar√≠amos un descanso de c√≥mo m√°ximo 10 minutos. Mi amiga y yo bajamos al ba√±o de la gasolinera y en cuatro minutos ya hab√≠amos acabado y nos dirigimos de nuevo al autob√∫s, y para nuestra sorpresa al llegar al parking no vimos el bus por ning√∫n lugar. Nos hab√≠a dejado tirados en medio de la nada y se hab√≠a llevado todo nuestro equipaje, con cosas de importante valor econ√≥mico y personal, qued√°ndonos por suerte solo con nuestras carteras y tel√©fonos.El conductor en ning√∫n momento se preocup√≥ por chequear que todos los pasajeros estuviesen a bordo. Para colmo, llamamos numerosas veces al n√∫mero de emergencias de Flixbus para que diesen aviso de que nuestro equipaje se encontraba en el autob√∫s y de que est√°bamos tirados a 160 km de nuestro destino en medio de la nada a las tantas de la madrugada. No solo desde la compa√±√≠a no nos ofrecieron ninguna soluci√≥n para ir a nuestro destino, sino que durante una hora y media que le quedaba al autob√∫s de viaje no fueron capaces de contactar con el conductor ni con la estaci√≥n para explicarles nuestro caso.Me parece inhumano el trato que recibimos, ya ni hablar de que no hemos recibido ning√∫n tipo de compensaci√≥n econ√≥mica y a d√≠a de hoy (2 meses) seguimos sin recuperar nuestro equipaje y no nos ofrecen ayuda para encontrarlo.",5,PT,2024-09-30,Trustpilot

Pre√ßos bons e pontualidade.,"i wasn't able to buy a ticket online, had to ask a friend to do so through the app.There is no traveler info AT ALL at Nepliget (HU) station, even though it's a flixbus hub, so you see ""well done"" in sweat people running around to try to find their rides, pulling suitcases behind them in a country where most of the people don't speak EN. Very comforting experience - I went to the international info, but the women there hated her job, so instead of information, I got abused...shouldn't this company squeeze to the budget having a smiling, EN speaker human being helping the travelers and the drivers where there is a flixbus in every half an hour?!I had to guard my luggage as other travelers are animals and treat others stuff as crap - I'm expecting flixbus crew does this and not the driver!!!This driver was OK.but I also know flixbus is not controlling their subcontractors, so there are many deadly tired drivers (having an 8 hrs shift on public transportation in the morning, then in the evening sitting behind a flixbus wheel for a 15hrs ride, WARNING! digital tachograph cards are not used in public services - those driving hrs are not r√©gistered - so they can easily overdrive and as they are not paid for their jobs, they are forced to do this...or they just simply didn't sleep last night as their accomodation does not include AC in 40¬∞C Summers...I am a private home cleaner, charging 6000 HUF (15‚Ç¨/hr for my easy peasy, non-responsible for anything, don't have to deal with stoidi, can be late, tired at job, sit down for a coffee or go to the toilet anytime). Hungarian flixbus drivers do not earn half of it for their clearly stressful, dealing with stoidi (on the road and inside the vehicle), being responsible for 49 lifes behind her/him and for the end of the day, yes, bonus is to clean these buses after 15 hrs ride and before another one. Good that their tacho card is out, so the company stays clear as their drivers are already resting... I think police would need to act as this is a crime - risking everyones lives on the road.so basically for these reasons (I've been sitting behind a driver almost falling asleep on the highway on my very first ride with flixbus years ago) I use flixbus, where there is no other chance (HU has been cut from international train rides) and I would notdo any long rides to risk dying on a highway, because some people decide profit is more important than human beings lives. Mine, the drivers are not worth anything, but theirs are so precoius, they can sacrifice us for another Maserati...",5,CA,2024-09-30,Trustpilot

Geo-Deutsche Man,"This bus trip was a DISASTER! The bus was 40 minutes late, the driver was nice, but had ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS GOING. He didn't know how to get to any of the stops, he didn't have a clue what to do at the border. If my wife and I had not taken this bus trip literally hundreds of times over the last 15 years I don't know what would have happened. We had to tell him what to do at the border, where to drive the bus. Literally EVERYTHING.... he didn't know he was supposed to give us forms, he didn't give any instructions to the passengers, and it was clear the majority of them had never taken this trip before (and clearly will not be traveling with FLIX again). My wife gave instructions to all the passengers ( don't get off the bus until the driver tells you to, take everything with you, make sure your forms are filled out, one per household, don't get back on the bus until it pulls forward).... seriously. everything. If this was all that occurred I would place the blame solidly on FLIX..... BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE..... This driver was so distracted it was insane. He almost hit/smashed/sideswiped numerous vehicles.

If you're stuck using them because of no other options, here's what to do (   I learned this  hard way): * Be vigilant: Keep a close eye on your belongings in the boot, especially at stops. People have language stolen all the time. * Don't leave the bus: They've been known to leave without passengers. * Get insurance: Flixbus has a history of technical problems. * Expect the unexpected: Their drivers can be reckless, and accidents are not uncommon. * Avoid the restrooms: They're often unusable and disgusting. * Don't bother with complaints: Their customer service is a joke.I lost my passport and laptop on a Flixbus trip, and the recovery process was a nightmare.

He insisted on cash payment and did not provide a receipt or ticket. When I contacted customer service, they were unhelpful and could not assist without a receipt. I was promised an email for an investigation, but I have not received anything yet. Overall, it was a terrible experience with poor customer service. I advise caution when purchasing tickets from drivers and recommend checking the official app for accurate pricing.",5,DK,2024-09-27,Trustpilot
Affordable and comfy bus ride,"We were scheduled to take the FlixBus from Copenhagen to Odense at 21:20 and arrived 20 minutes early to ensure we had plenty of time. According to the departure board, our bus was supposed to leave from a specific platform, so we waited there. However, to our frustration, the bus ended up being at a completely different location on the large terminal, and we missed it.We had no choice but to purchase new tickets, which were significantly more expensive, though luckily we only had to wait 50 minutes for the next bus. Once again, we carefully followed the instructions on the departure board and waited at the designated platform. But unbelievably, the same thing happened again‚Äîthe bus did not stop at the indicated platform! Fortunately, we saw it drive by and managed to run and catch it.When we asked the driver why the bus didn‚Äôt stop at the assigned platform, he simply said it wasn‚Äôt his problem. After this, I contacted FlixBus support to get a refund for the bus we missed, but they replied that since the bus had arrived at the terminal, it wasn‚Äôt their responsibility. This is completely unreasonable considering the size of the Copenhagen bus terminal, which is enormous, with buses traveling to destinations all over Europe, including places like Paris and Oslo. How are passengers expected to find their bus if they can‚Äôt rely on the platform numbers displayed on the boards and tickets?FlixBus‚Äô customer service was extremely poor, and they refused to take responsibility for the mistake. This was a deeply frustrating and chaotic experience. I will never use FlixBus again and would not recommend them to anyone.",5,US,2024-09-27,Trustpilot

Flixbus is great,"Guten Tag,ich habe einen Monat gewartet, um meine FlixBus-Fahrt zu bewerten.Am 19.8.2024 bin ich mit FlixBus von Hamburg nach Kiew gefahren und am 20.8.2024 zur√ºck.

Wouldn‚Äôt let me put zero,"When I had to reschedule, I used the company's website to manage my trip plan. The site has some issues and made me repay for the same trip I initially booked. I tried to get help from so-called Customer Support, which never listened to the problem and was adamant that I must pay more ( 3rd time) if I wanted to reschedule. I eventually ended up paying 3x money because I had no other option at that point.Details:I booked tickets for a route for the 19th of September. Due to some personal issues, I decided I would reschedule and travel on the 20th only(the same time and same route). I called customer service and then used the Flixbus website to manage my travel time as suggested by customer service. During rescheduling, I had chosen 20th September as my new date of traveling, but somehow, I was sent 19th September, the same route ticket in my email. I called customer support back to let them know about the issue. I wanted to get help from them to amend the issue with my ticket so that I can travel on the 20th. They asked me to pay 3rd time and said they couldn't amend the wrong ticket. I already had paid almost the full ticket price to reschedule my ticket ( 51$ original price, then 41 $ to reschedule), and then I was again asked to pay more.I asked them how the system could send me the same date ticket when I had paid to reschedule and told them that there was some kind of issue with the date selection mechanism on the website. I just wanted them to amend my ticket and no refund or anything. Still, the customer support office did not listen to me, rudely talked to me, and told me that I would have to pay more if I wanted to travel. Having no other option on that day, I paid 41$ more to again reschedule. So eventually I ended up paying ( 51+41+41 + taxes = 137$$).If a customer can't be helped in such a scenario, why is there customer service at FlixBus?How can a reschedule option allow you to select the same date /route if it was a user mistake?Suppose it was a case of user mistake; how can a service take more money to fix the issue? Customer support should be able to fix that internally without charging as the customer already paid double to reschedule.",1,HU,2024-09-25,Trustpilot

Ease and value,"imagine spending 19 hours on a bus trip to get to your relatives to see them in another country, then the last bus that you need to get on (which is only like 3 hours away from your destination) goes past you, ignoring you completely, while also being 30 minutes late and the bus driver telling you ""its late"" and going away, leaving you with heavy luggage and your family outside in the evening and no other bus to be available that day? That's exactly what happened to me and my family. I had to chase the bus and wave my hands for them to see me and they just left. No we weren't late, we were waiting for 2 hours on that bus stop for them to not even stop??? how is this normal or humane? we had to pay 170‚Ç¨ for one night in a local hotel because of this, thanks for making me waste money and such treatment. Safe to say you lost a customer, I've been using Flixbus for over 2 years and this has never happened before, and I will make sure will never happen again, because I'm not using Flixbus again.

All passanger should sit on their own seat which assigned,"We were travelling from Lisbon to Porto when the wildfires occurred in Aveiro. While we understand that this was a very serious, and dangerous event - the bus driver did not communicate any information or updates to ease the stressful situation. It was up to passengers to determine alternative arrangements. Once trains were approved to return to service, passengers were left to make decisions about whether to remain with the bus or pay a little extra to train it to Porto. We were fortunate to meet a few people that spoke Portuguese and were able to translate to English, what options might work for us. The bus driver did not relay any information directly or remain on the bus to assure people. Company should have better communication services available for emergency conditions. Flixbus did send out an email the following day, to offer a 10% discount on future trips, but for many of us... there would not be an opportunity to use it, as we had flights heading home.",1,BA,2024-09-23,Trustpilot

Since my bus was supposed to stop in Birmingham, I asked the driver of the Birmingham-bound bus if this was the service to London, but he assured me it was not. Other passengers were also affected by this confusion.It remains unclear whether the London-bound bus failed to show up or if the Birmingham-bound bus was in fact the correct one, and we were given incorrect information by the driver.As a result of this service failure, I was forced to book a train ticket from Manchester to London at the cost of ¬£77.79",5,DE,2024-09-23,Trustpilot

Perfect ,"The pick up spot for Wasaga Beach, Ontario is listed on the wrong side of the road. I was already on the bus and saw the people there and asked the driver to wait. The driver refused to wait one minute for them to cross the road, and seemed to enjoy leaving them there. When I asked him why he did this, he said he had been leaving people there for three months because Flix doesn‚Äôt care to fix the information on their website so why should he care? Shockingly bad service. I found out later that the people he left behind missed their flight as they didn‚Äôt have another way to the airport. I have just read your reply that passengers are being picked up from the stop mentioned. This is not true - if they catch the bus going from Wasaga to Toronto, it is because a driver waited for them to cross the busy road, which my driver did not. Flix has listed the bus stop as being at the Esso station, which is the wrong side of a very busy road. Flix, your response was unsatisfactory - instead of writing a lie as a response, please reply that you have fixed the pick up point listed on your website for  Wasaga Beach going towards Toronto Airport! It should say that the stop is actually on the Superstore side of the road. This is the only confusing part. It can‚Äôt be hard for you to fix this so other people do not miss the bus ride they have paid for and are counting on to get to the airport! I will check the website and hope to see you fix it soon.

Great service,"Nunca pens√© que llegar√≠a a escribir una mala opini√≥n al respecto de un viaje con la compa√±√≠a FlixBus. No s√© ni cuantos viajes he realizado con la compa√±√≠a por toda Europa y en ning√∫n momento he sentido ning√∫n malestar o alguna falta de respeto como cliente. No obstante, lleg√≥ el d√≠a que cambio al completo mi imagen sobre la empresa. Fue el S√°bado 7 de Septiembre, conexi√≥n de Ginebra a Mil√°n, con un transbordo a B√©rgamo. La cosa ya empez√≥ mal, ten√≠amos que coger el bus a las 5:30 de la ma√±ana en Ginebra, pero viendo en el GPS la ubicaci√≥n del bus, este indicaba que estaba lejos de la ciudad y que se iba a retrasar unos 30 minutos. M√°s tarde, volvimos a ver como estaba y cada vez tardaba m√°s, esta vez con 1 hora de retraso. Ya cuando se iba acercando la hora, fuimos a la estaci√≥n de buses y est√°bamos todos los pasajeros esperando ante la incertidumbre de cu√°nto tiempo m√°s se va a retrasar el bus. Lleg√≥ casi 2 horas de retraso, pero que casualidad que lleg√≥ unos minutos antes para as√≠ no poder reclamar como cliente el retraso del bus. Ya ve√≠a que iba ajustado para llegar a Mil√°n y coger el transbordo a Bergamo, pero a√∫n as√≠ ten√≠a esperanza de que iba a llegar con tiempo. La cosa fue peor, bajaron los dos conductores de autob√∫s,  que supuestamente hablaban ingl√©s, sin embargo, le pregunt√© en ingl√©s que pasaba con mi transbordo a Bergamo, si iba a llegar con tiempo, y donde guardaba la maleta, y me respondi√≥ literalmente: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. Ya not√© la poca educaci√≥n que ten√≠a uno de los conductores cuando una mujer francesa le pregunt√≥ algo en franc√©s, y dijo de manera maleducada que lo diga en ingl√©s, y cuando se lo comento en ingl√©s, dijo de nuevo: ‚ÄúNo, I dont know‚Äù. Nos montamos en el bus y el resto de viaje fue bien, hasta que antes de llegar a la frontera del bus se pararon en el medio de la nada para que los conductores puedan fumar (algo que repitieron mucho en el viaje). No pararon ni en una gasolinera o zona de descanso para que podamos ir a un aseo en condiciones. En la frontera con Italia, nos pararon, y eso no hubo problema, el problema fue que tuvimos que esperar casi 1 hora, lo que se acumul√≥ m√°s el retraso para llegar a Mil√°n. Bajaron a 3 personas por no tener los papeles en regla (vaya control hace los conductores con respecto a la documentaci√≥n‚Ä¶) Seguimos nuestro camino con retraso hasta la siguiente parada, Aosta, en el cual no hubo problema. La guinda del pastel fue ir por la autopista direcci√≥n Mil√°n, pero por las obras no se pod√≠a continuar y ten√≠a que ir por carretera nacional. Literalmente los conductores se dieron 3 veces la misma vuelta, perdiendo otra hora para saber por donde ir. Los pasajeros est√°bamos desesperados, los conductores no nos dec√≠an nada (obviamente porque ni ingl√©s sab√≠an hablar) y hubieron algunos pasajeros que quer√≠an ayudar, indicando que pod√≠an ir por Tur√≠n y luego ir hacia Mil√°n, pero cuando se acercaban los echaban de manera maleducada. Tras saber por donde ir, seguimos la carretera nacional, ya con la certeza de que no √≠bamos a llegar a mi correspondencia hacia Bergamo, ni en el siguiente. Ten√≠amos que estar en Mil√°n a las 11:00 de la ma√±ana, y est√°bamos en el bus todav√≠a de camino a las 14:00 (sin poder haber cogido el siguiente bus que iba a ser a las 14:30). Con 20 minutos llegando a Mil√°n, tuvieron que hacer una parada en la gasolinera, obviamente para que fumen los conductores. Mi pareja ten√≠a un problema de higiene femenina e intentando comentar su situaci√≥n al conductor, no nos hizo caso y nos mand√≥ de vuelta al bus. Con suerte o no, llegamos a las 15:00 a la estaci√≥n de Mil√°n. No nos dijeron que lo sent√≠an por el retraso de 4 HORAS, y lo que faltaba es que tuve que meterme hasta dentro del maletero para coger mi maleta que estaba en el fondo, pudiendo haber abierto la otra puerta perfectamente. La siguiente correspondencia a Bergamo era a las 20:30. Es decir, ten√≠amos que estar all√≠ esperando 5 horas en la estaci√≥n de buses para poder coger el bus que desgraciadamente ten√≠amos que coger en vez que el de las 12 de la ma√±ana. Una estaci√≥n que no es de las m√°s seguras de Europa‚Ä¶ Mi pareja y yo tuvimos que ir con el maleton a coger un metro y un tren, cansados y hambrientos, para poder llegar finalmente al destino deseado. Hemos reclamado en la p√°gina, pero s√≥lo nos devolvieron el bus que perdimos hacia Bergamo, sin devolver nada del retraso que tuvimos del primer bus de Ginebra a Mil√°n. Ha sido una falta de respeto como cliente y el perjuicio que provoc√≥ no tiene precedentes. Por lo menos devolver una cantidad simb√≥lica por los da√±os y perjuicios del viaje, sabiendo que nos gastamos en total mi pareja y yo casi 90‚Ç¨. Claramente no volver√© a usar esta empresa nunca m√°s y esta vez ir√© de viaje con otra compa√±√≠a de la competencia. ",5,GB,2024-09-22,Trustpilot

pro and cons,"Cleanliness, nice AC, wifi was good, just that many passengers were speaking too loud either on the phone or among themselves, no respect for personal spaces or common quiet environment. Also the tight/small over head compartments needs to be advertised in bigger scale, many passengers came with over size carry on and contributed in delays, and or taking more seating spaces onboard.company should find away to emphasize the carry on policy in advertising and before passenger booking.

And how rude the bus driver was to a passenger. His No food or drink signs looked like they were homemade. He made me finish my coffee before I got on the bus, but several of us had to!!!

Excellent service. ,Appalling service. Booked a coach from Trogir to Split as part of our holiday. Bus never arrived. Tried to arrange refund. Was initially told that the bus had arrived but having waited at the small bus station in Trogir for an hour (with several other passengers also waiting for the bus) there was no way that the bus had pulled up in the station. The app actually showed that the bus was midway between Trogir and Split so it had clearly just driven past. When we got home we tried to arrange the refund to be told they could not offer a refund due to the processing fee (15 euros pp) being higher than the original price. How pathetic. The bus never arrived so surely that should override any extortionate processing fees. I would have given 0 stars for this company if it had been an option. Avoid at all costs. ,5,ES,2024-09-21,Trustpilot

Easy and fast booking,"I recently had a very disappointing experience with FlixBus during my journey from Budva AS to Tirana East Gate Lindor on August 11, 2024. Despite booking through FlixBus, the service was operated by a partner company, Jadran Ekspres Kotor. While the ticket mentioned that the bus wouldn't have FlixBus branding, this does not justify the subpar service provided. I reached out to FlixBus multiple times seeking assistance and resolution for the issues I encountered. However, their response was to redirect me to the partner company, stating that they were not responsible for the journey despite being the contracting party. This refusal to take responsibility and help resolve my issues is not what I expected from a company like FlixBus. Given the lack of support and accountability, I am now left to warn other potential customers. If you are considering using FlixBus for your travels, be aware that they may not assist you in case of any issues during your journey, especially if it's operated by a third party. Unfortunately, my experience with FlixBus has been far from satisfactory, and I hope others will take this into account when choosing their travel provider.",5,US,2024-09-21,Trustpilot
Tipping the Scales,"Tive uma experi√™ncia extremamente negativa com a FlixBus na minha viagem de regresso de Lisboa (Oriente) para o Porto, no dia 15/09/2024, pelas 16:30. A experi√™ncia foi marcada por um atendimento muito mau e por pr√°ticas extremamente frustrantes.Fomos impedidos de embarcar com os nossos filhos (de 5 e 3 anos) pelo condutor da rota 1000 e pelo supervisor de esta√ß√£o (Oriente), que n√£o estavam devidamente identificados. Informaram-nos de forma rude que a crian√ßa de 3 anos precisava de uma cadeirinha especial, uma informa√ß√£o que n√£o foi comunicada durante o processo de reserva online, onde indic√°mos a idade das crian√ßas.O supervisor, sem qualquer identifica√ß√£o vis√≠vel, ainda nos orientou a comprar uma cadeirinha no supermercado Continente da Esta√ß√£o Oriente e disse que ter√≠amos de adquirir novos bilhetes para poder embarcar. Esta exig√™ncia, que n√£o foi previamente mencionada, e a recusa dos funcion√°rios em fornecer a identifica√ß√£o violam o Decreto-Lei n.¬∫ 9/2015, de 15 de janeiro, da Lei Portuguesa, que exige que os funcion√°rios estejam identificados e apresentem essa identifica√ß√£o quando solicitado.Al√©m de toda a rudeza e falta de transpar√™ncia, fomos for√ßados a adquirir novos bilhetes na Rede Expresso, onde recebemos um atendimento muito mais respeitoso e fomos informados corretamente sobre as condi√ß√µes de transporte para crian√ßas.Entrei em contacto com a linha de apoio ao cliente da FlixBus, mas a situa√ß√£o foi tratada de forma insatisfat√≥ria, sem a possibilidade de apresentar uma queixa formal sobre os funcion√°rios envolvidos.Gostaria de refor√ßar que a FlixBus falhou em comunicar claramente, durante o processo de reserva, a exig√™ncia de cadeirinha para crian√ßas menores de 3 anos. Ao simular uma reserva no site FlixBus.pt, constatei que, ap√≥s seleccionar o m√©todo de pagamento, apenas √© apresentada a aceita√ß√£o da Declara√ß√£o de Privacidade, sem qualquer men√ß√£o √† necessidade da cadeirinha. Esta falha n√£o s√≥ viola os direitos dos consumidores, como demonstra falta de clareza nas informa√ß√µes prestadas.A FlixBus, antes de contestar reclama√ß√µes, deveria testar adequadamente os seus canais de venda para identificar falhas ou bugs. O envio de printscreens como prova, embora √∫til, n√£o substitui a responsabilidade de garantir que o servi√ßo prestado √© eficiente e livre de erros.Embora me tenham oferecido um voucher de 25% como ""gesto de boa vontade"", considero que, dado o incumprimento das normas e a m√° conduta dos motoristas, um reembolso integral seria o mais justo.Recomendo vivamente que revejam as vossas pr√°ticas e melhorem a comunica√ß√£o com os clientes. A falta de informa√ß√£o e o tratamento desrespeitoso que recebemos s√£o inaceit√°veis.",5,IE,2024-09-21,Trustpilot

I wrote a complaint to customer service and provided screenshots of the delays and they had the audacity to tell me that the bus schedule was on time!! I called them and they are not even taking the responsibility of the delay! And I was told that I was supposed to be there 15 minutes ahead of the initial departure time (3:15) which is stupid. Why would I go there from 3 pm if you‚Äôre telling me that the bus departures at 3:59!!! They didn‚Äôt even compensate for my alternative transportation.

Tot molt b√©,"I rarely post negative reviews but I‚Äôm very disappointed with Flixbus and will never use them again.I was among a group of 13 passengers left stranded at Niagara Falls bus stop, because the bus we were booked onto came and went without stopping to pick us up. Myself and my husband (and other stranded passengers) had no choice but to go online and buy tickets for the later bus (an extra 50 dollars) back to Toronto, then wait. Just to be clear, we were in the right place at the right time (we were actually at the stop 15 mins early) and even tracking our bus on the app. But we never saw it physically arrive or leave.When I emailed the company, explaining what happened and requesting a refund for those extra tickets, they took almost two weeks to reply, then informed me that while they are very sorry my experience ‚Äúfell so far short of expectations‚Äù, they couldn‚Äôt provide a refund as the bus ‚Äúwas operating as scheduled‚Äù and did pick up some passengers (just not all!).Won‚Äôt be using Flixbus again, that‚Äôs for sure.

Egentlig altid tilfreds. Men ig√•r der blev det en kende for meget. Flixbus nr. N24 fra Hannover til Hamborg. Chauff√∏ren stod med cigaret i munden imens han checkede passagerer ind. Da det blev min tur til at f√• checket min billet r√∏g et par k√¶mpe store gl√∏der af hans cigaret ned i min taske og lavede 2 sm√• br√¶ndem√¶rker i tasken. Han sagde en hel masse p√• italiensk som han ikke troede jeg forstod...men det gjorde jeg ... chauff√∏ren sagde f√∏lgende ""du kan sgu da bare lade v√¶re med at st√• s√• t√¶t p√• med din bagage!""

Bussen var ul√¶kker, manglede s√¶be og toiletpapir. Bordet var m√∏gbeskidt med gamle madrester nede i kaffeholderne.

A pleasant travel.,"Our, that's me, my wife and 6 yr old daughter's journey, was in Turkey, from Goreme to Fethiye, and was meant to take 11 & 1/2 hours; (it actually took 13hrs).Anyway, I'll TRY to be succinct. I was told that night buses in Turkey were good; this one was NOT!-- No toilet on board; and no English spoken, so VERY difficult to know if one had time to try to find one at one of the 15 or so stops. (It seemed that the bus stopped for as much time as it moved; with the drivers probably having 4 meals!)-- These 2 drivers were allowed to smoke; so the bus was full of it, which makes me choke.-- I measured it, and the distance between the front of my single seat and the back of the one in front, was barely 20cm!!-- The smallest I have ever witnessed; even on a bus travelling a short distance, never mind this sort of distance. In fact, so close were the seats, that the lad who worked on the bus doing all the jobs bar the driving, had to ask many of the passengers to raise the backs of them....for the entire journey.-- The seats themselves were extremely uncomfortable, (not just mine), with metal jabbing into one's back.-- In fact, there were many things that didn't work on this vehicle that was in very poor repair.....i.e. overhead and floor lighting; fans; the clock at the front etc etc. And obviously there was no wi-fi.Suffice to say that I couldn't get a minute's rest, let alone any sleep; and I never properly recovered for the remainder of the holiday.My wife had booked this journey; but in future I will be EXTREMELY careful to double-check what has been booked.-------In answer to the answer from Flix, I have tried going to where I was instructed, but it just goes/reverts to flixbus.co.uk, with no sign of any form to fill in??And, even if I were ever to come across a form to fill in, what sort of form are you referring to?-------No, I've tried it again tonight and it still doesn't work.

Viagem tranquila e condutor muito‚Ä¶,"I booked in June and received a ticket by email. Before leaving for my trip last week, I tried to load the ticket in the Flixbus mobile app but it didn't recognize my booking number or email address, so I brought the ticket I'd been emailed in June with me. The departure address on that ticket was no longer valid, but Flixbus hadn't notified me that they'd changed the departure address so I waited 90 minutes in the dark for a bus that didn't come and was stuck in Seattle with my 9 year old disabled child.Followup: I called customer support Monday and they told me that they could see in their computer that I changed my departure location and therefore the problem was my own fault. That makes no sense: not only did I not change anything after booking my ticket, but I have no control over where the bus departs from.Now they are claiming, again with no proof, that I received an SMS about the change. Looking at the Flixbus online booking process, they don't ask for a phone number when selling a ticket‚Äîjust name and email address‚Äîso I'm not sure how they would even have my phone number. While I could've missed a text message, searching my entire message history for the words ""Flixbus,"" ""departure,"" ""station,"" ""Lane"" (the departure address printed on my ticket), and ""Brougham"" (the updated departure address), I find no message from Flixbus.",5,US,2024-09-14,Trustpilot

The seat belts were not working.,"Flixbus stole my money. I recently traveled NYC to Niagara Falls on Flixbus and purchased my 4 tickets a couple of months in advance. I was charged extra to reserve seats so we could all sit together. They first switched my bus and put 3 of us together. I tried a few times to reach customer service. They hung up on me or unresponsive in the online chat. So I just paid the extra again to change 1 seat to be with the rest of the group. The day we were set to travel we showed up to the bus stop early like requested and there was 1 person in a vest working there. I asked them about my bus showing them my ticket and they said the bus hadn't showed up yet. So we waited and our departure time came and went. So I talked to different person in a vest working there because the other person had left and they told me the bus number on my ticket was not the right number and our bus had already left! I called customer service and they couldn't confirm my reservation number so they hung up on me. I finally talked to someone and they could not refund my money and they couldn't help me make a new reservation, they didn't do anything to help me. Luckily I was able to pay cash to another driver to hitch a ride. This was my mothers dream to go to Niagara and it was almost ruined by this awful company. I will say the driver was very professional and nice. Once we were on our way everything was okay.  ",4,CA,2024-09-08,Trustpilot

Thanks Flix,"I‚Äôm don‚Äôt usually leave negative reviews, but I was particularly alarmed by this trip.While trying to find my seat, I was verbally harassed by a man towards the back of the bus. He was shouting that I should have arrived earlier if I wanted a specific seat (I was 10 minutes early) and that I needed to ‚Äúsit the f&@! down‚Äù. He then walked up and down the aisle selling water and chargers to people while continuing to shout. He was not a passenger and the driver was watching. So, the driver had not only let a non-passenger on the bus, but did not intervene when the man verbally harassed several passengers. I felt incredibly unsafe. Despite purchasing a seat, I was unable to use it because someone else was in it. She refused to move because her seat had also be taken. It became apparent that most of the passengers had ignored the seat assignments and the driver was unwilling to rectify this.I grabbed an open seat, though I had to move later because the passenger who was assigned that seat boarded at the next stop. On top of the boarding and seat chaos, the vent controlling the AC at my seat was broken so I was unable to turn it down. I was freezing. The seat adjustment lever was also broken. Whenever, I leaned back on the seat to relax, it would pop out of place and the seat would jolt backwards. I had to sit sideways after I had to keep fixing the seat. One of the outlets at the seat didn‚Äôt work either and the WiFi was very slow. If it was just the internet and the seat, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have said anything. It was a cheap bus ticket after all, but the street vendor on the bus yelling at me was quite scary. And I didn‚Äôt get the seat I had paid for.Also, we were 30 minutes late arriving at our destination and the driver gave no delay warnings or updates. In fact, the only time the driver spoke to us was to announce the stop name. He never gave us a safety briefing or any sort of greeting/explanation.",5,JP,2024-09-08,Trustpilot

When I realized it, I canceled my initial ticket and rebooked with the right date of Sept 2.

I called and wanted a refund for my first ticked which I had canceled, I was informed that a travel voucher was issued for my next travel, but I do not have plans to travel again anytime soon.

Easy,"FlIX Bus has a bare bones idea of providing customer service and they suggest handling all booking / cancellations online or the app. However their refund policy strictly benefits FLIX , their shareholders etc.. Their policy is that if the Trip is not cancelled or delayed on FlIX's end then so my hard earned dollars are gone  then I receive a voucher!?!? Trip plans changed and had to cancel( two days in advance) Why would I EVER want to travel with a company who handles their  customers this way!!!! To make matters even more unacceptable  FlIX keeps FiFty percent of my money to cover cancellation fees!!!!!!!So now I have been issued a voucher for an amount greatly reduced , it would have been more pleasant to travel on foot than deal with FLIX bus.I hope future customers will not have to experience this, I will MOST definitely NOT be using FLIX bus again!!!!",4,CA,2024-09-06,Trustpilot
I like that is a fast trip,"Boa tarde, venho aqui escrever a minha insatisfa√ß√£o com a viagem. Primeiro de tudo o autocarro estava com muito mau cheiro, um cheiro infernal de sujidades, depois tinha pessoas deitadas nos bancos o que estavam a ocupar lugares que n√≥s nos pod√≠amos sentar. Depois eu e o meu namorado n√£o t√≠nhamos onde ficar juntos, por acaso houve um senhor que cedeu-me o lugar dele pra eu ficar perto do meu namorado. Pra finalizar ficamos nos lugares do lado da casa de banho e em frente de um casal todo sujo e cheirando mal, n√£o bastava o cheiro horr√≠vel da casa de banho e ainda tivemos que levar com aquilo.

Love the way FlixBus operate,"Comprei bilhete para a viagem Portim√£o-Barcelos no dia 31/08/2024. Essa viagem envolvia uma escala em Lisboa-Oriente. Ambos os trajetos eram realizados por autocarros Flixbus.Era suposto chegar a Lisboa-Oriente √†s 14:20, com embarque em novo autocarro √†s 15:45. Houve atraso do autocarro durante a viagem, com chegada a Lisboa Oriente por volta das 15:50-16:00, hora √† qual o segundo autocarro com dire√ß√£o a Barcelos j√° tinha partido. Durante esta mesma viagem de Portim√£o-Lisboa houve uma paragem numa esta√ß√£o de servi√ßo que durou 20 minutos, paragem essa que se n√£o tivesse sido realizada teria resultado numa chegada cedo o suficiente para a troca de autocarro. Fui obrigado a comprar bilhete para Braga, o destino mais pr√≥ximo de Barcelos, porque o pr√≥ximo autocarro para Barcelos s√≥ partia por volta das 22:00h. Ou seja, para al√©m de ter sido obrigado a gastar dinheiro num bilhete extra ainda tive de arranjar transporte de Braga at√© Barcelos.E eis a minha surpresa que, quando contacto a Flixbus para pedido de reembolso do bilhete relativo √† viagem perdida, me informam que n√£o tenho direito a ser reembolsado, apesar de ter perdido o autocarro por culpa do atraso da pr√≥pria Flixbus.Ou seja, quem comprar bilhetes na Flixbus tem que estar consciente de que pode n√£o chegar ao destino prometido e que nem direito a reembolso tem caso isso aconte√ßa. Portanto, n√£o recomendo e n√£o voltarei a viajar com esta companhia.",5,HR,2024-09-05,Trustpilot

Looking for a green and black bus‚Ä¶,"This is my first time to use FlixBus, and also the last time. It is not reliable at all. I heard that FlixBus likes to cancel trip and wait until late Sunday afternoon to book the trip on following Monday at 5:30am; the entire night, I could not sleep well, as need to get up at 5am rather 7am as usual schedule. However, at 5am, I checked email, FlixBus cancelled trip at Sunday 11:20pm, which is really late and last minute. I rebook the time to depart at 7am, at 6:57am, it says delayed until 8am! From 5am-8am, I am struggling with this bus, and it completely messes up my diary, I have a very busy schedule on Monday, now I am suffering from much less sleep and complains from others because of this transportation delay! It is only 1h - 1.5h drive to my destination, I am wasting entire night and morning for this bus, no recommendation, take the train next time. ",1,IT,2024-09-05,Trustpilot

All the way to make the reservations‚Ä¶,"I recently took a round trip with FlixBus from Toronto Union Station to Parry Sound, and it was an experience I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone else to go through. Here‚Äôs why:Disgusting Toilets: The toilets on both trips were in a deplorable state. It was so bad that I had to avoid using them entirely, which made the long journey even more uncomfortable.Chaos with Seating and Boarding: Despite having reserved seats, passengers were boarding and taking seats at random stops, with no regard for reservations. An elderly couple couldn‚Äôt find proper seating, and there was no staff to help organize the situation.Lack of Signage and Disorganization: The FlixBus app pointed out where the pick-up would be, but there was no signage at the location. Passengers were scattered, confused, and the bus was delayed both times. We even had to rely on a competing bus company‚Äôs driver to tell us where to wait!Unacceptable Driver Behavior: The worst part of the trip was the driver‚Äôs attitude on our return journey. My 8-year-old son started feeling unwell, so we decided to get off one stop earlier at Pearson Airport. When we politely asked the driver to retrieve our luggage, he became hostile, raised his voice, and even made sarcastic remarks. It was embarrassing, distressing, and completely uncalled for, especially in front of my child and the other passengers.I understand that FlixBus is a low-cost service, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse the poor treatment of passengers. From the lack of basic hygiene to the aggressive behavior of the driver, this trip was a disaster. I won‚Äôt be using FlixBus again and strongly advise others to consider alternative options. No one should have to experience what my family and I went through.",5,US,2024-09-05,Trustpilot

Awesome experience!,"AVOID: I purchased a ticket to travel from Heathrow to Gatwick. The bus was delayed by at least 30 minutes, forcing me to purchase another ticket from a different company to ensure I would arrive on time for my flight. The company's bus schedule is not reliable, and there is a risk of missing your flight. It's important to note that they do not offer refunds if the bus is delayed by less than 2 hours, resulting in a loss of ¬£12 for me.FYI Flixbus answered my review, and this is my answer to it!,#I realized that you cannot offer anything. The overall service of Flixbus at the airport is hideous because there are not many services available if one bus is late. If your bus is late and the estimated time of arrival is not accurate, anyone could miss a flight. If your bus is later than 120 minutes you can offer a refund, but if that was the case, it would be a disaster for your customers as 100% of them would have missed their flights!!Your whole system is disgraceful. I work in a very strong airline at Heathrow, and I will make sure that none of my colleagues, customers, or stakeholders use your service#",5,US,2024-09-04,Trustpilot

WIFI did not work!,"Ik had onlangs een zeer teleurstellende ervaring met FlixBus. Een reis die zou worden uitgevoerd door een derde partij genaamd Lajkonik. Ik heb de reis nooit kunnen maken, doordat niet goed werd aangegeven waar het opstartplatform was. Naar aanleiding daarvan had ik een klacht die ik aan FlixBus wilde voorleggen. Tot mijn verbazing werd ik echter doorverwezen naar de derde partij om mijn probleem op te lossen, met het excuus dat FlixBus geen toegang had tot mijn registratiegegevens.Dit is niet alleen frustrerend, maar ook juridisch onjuist. Volgens het Nederlandse recht is FlixBus, als contractspartij, verantwoordelijk voor de uitvoering van de dienst, zelfs als deze is uitbesteed aan een derde partij. Artikel 6:76 BW bevestigt dat FlixBus aansprakelijk blijft voor de acties van hun partners. Desondanks werd ik driemaal afgewimpeld met nagenoeg dezelfde mails zonder in te gaan op mijn vragen en argumenten waarom zij wel verantwoordelijk zijn en moest ik mijn klacht elders indienen.Deze manier van werken toont een gebrek aan verantwoordelijkheid en klantenservice. Ik verwachtte meer van een groot bedrijf als FlixBus, vooral omdat ik als klant de overeenkomst met hen ben aangegaan. Dit soort situaties schaadt het vertrouwen in de service, en ik zal twee keer nadenken voordat ik opnieuw bij FlixBus boek.Hopelijk neemt FlixBus in de toekomst hun verantwoordelijkheid serieus en behandelt ze klachten correct, zonder klanten van het kastje naar de muur te sturen.Update 3 september: Flixbus komt met een reactie waar geen pijl op te trekken valt. Wat betekent het dat mijn dossier intern is verwerkt en gesloten? Ik heb nergens reactie gekregen en betekent dit dan dat zij bepalen of mijn klacht is afgehandeld? Ik ben erg benieuwd wat dit betekent. ",3,MX,2024-09-03,Trustpilot

Good service,"Ich habe bereits mehrere Male Flixbus oder die Bahn innerhalb Deutschlands genutzt und dabei auch keine gr√∂√üeren Probleme erlebt. Doch k√ºrzlich habe ich zum ersten Mal eine Reise mit Flixbus in die T√ºrkei gebucht ‚Äì ein wahrer Albtraum.Vorab muss ich erw√§hnen, dass ich vor einigen Jahren bereits mit einem t√ºrkischen Busunternehmen in die T√ºrkei gereist bin, und diese Erfahrung war um ein Vielfaches besser! Die Fahrer waren h√∂flich und zuvorkommend, und es gab ausreichend Stauraum √ºber den Sitzen, sodass man sein Gep√§ck bequem verstauen konnte.Im Gegensatz dazu waren die Busfahrer bei Flixbus extrem unh√∂flich und unsympathisch. Fragen wurden entweder nicht beantwortet oder schlichtweg ignoriert. Der begrenzte Stauraum √ºber den Sitzen zwang mich, meinen Rucksack unbequem zwischen den F√º√üen zu verstauen.Der wahre Horror begann jedoch, als die Busfahrer fr√ºher als vereinbart von einer serbischen Tankstelle abfuhren. Das Schlimmste daran: Es interessierte Flixbus √ºberhaupt nicht. Keine Hilfe, kein Entgegenkommen ‚Äì nichts. Man steht pl√∂tzlich in einem fremden Land, weit entfernt von der n√§chsten Stadt, und kann nichts tun! Es ist erschreckend, wie Flixbus keinerlei Verantwortung f√ºr die Sicherheit der Fahrg√§ste √ºbernimmt. H√§tte ich zumindest die M√∂glichkeit gehabt, die Fahrer zu kontaktieren, h√§tte ich vielleicht noch mit einem Taxi oder auf anderem Wege hinterherfahren k√∂nnen. Doch nein, Flixbus unternahm absolut nichts! Man ist v√∂llig auf sich allein gestellt.Eine weitere bittere Entt√§uschung war der Verlust meines Gep√§cks. Bei Flixbus kann man keine Art von Unterst√ºtzung oder Kooperation erwarten. Es ist ihnen v√∂llig egal, ob man sein verlorenes Gep√§ck jemals wiederfindet. Es scheint, als w√ºrde bei diesem Unternehmen nichts dokumentiert ‚Äì man hat zu keinem Zeitpunkt eine Ahnung, wie der Stand der Dinge ist, ob das Gep√§ck gefunden wurde, ob es dem Fundb√ºro √ºbergeben wurde, oder was auch immer. Jedes Gep√§ckst√ºck wird zwar mit einem Band und einer Nummer versehen, doch dann erh√§lt man nur die lapidare Auskunft, dass es m√∂glicherweise von einem anderen Kunden mitgenommen wurde.Dieses Unternehmen und alle Beteiligten sollten sich wirklich f√ºr dieses unerh√∂rte Verhalten sch√§men. Meiner Meinung nach stecken die Fahrer einfach die gefundenen Wertsachen ein, seien es Rucks√§cke, Koffer oder sonstige Gegenst√§nde.",5,ES,2024-09-03,Trustpilot

2 trajets 2 probl√®mes,"I would like to be constructive, but you will not find anything constructive in this review. I sincerely hope FlixBus will go bankrupt, but considering how much money they stole from me with their incompetence and negligence, probably that won't happen soon.I bought 4 tickets for my family to get from Krakow back home. Ticket said the bus might arrive to a number of platforms, so follow information at bus station, which I did.But guess what, the bus driver, bus station personnel and FlixBus staff didn't care about getting the bus to the correct platform. Any boarding platform will do in their opinion. So I missed the bus, because THE BUS was at wrong platform (obviously at the ""first platform"", but there is no such thing as 1st platform or platform 1 at Krakow bus station) and was not marked with either starting point of my itinerary not the end of my itinerary.Later, when I finally managed to find customer support number and called, I was made aware, that it is my fault that I didn't know that bus is ""always at first platform"" (meaning in this case ""we misinform every second traveller about boarding point"") and I should have checked other places and busses to find my bus. To be clear - about 0.5% of the staff speaks anything but Polish, good luck finding anything.So I had to purchase another tickets because I couldn't really wander around city at night finding hotel with ton of luggage and 2 small children.While boarding on that second bus, which arrived 5 minutes before departure (instead of 15-20) I POLITELY asked why is the bus at wrong platform (yes, it arrived again to the wrong platform) and got yelled at by the driver instead of any meaningful reply. Then driver yelled at my wife, at my children and continued to talk to me in high tone until I started filming him.Basically I'd give about -55 stars if I could.So if you use the FlixBus and they mix things up (you know what I wanted to write, a bit different expression), which they probably will do, it will be your fault, you will be yelled at and called an idiot.UPD 02.09.2024Got the e-mail from FlixBus,  full quote below.""Hello Konstantin,We hope this email finds you well.We are contacting you regarding your review on the TrustPilot platform.Please accept our heartfelt apologies for any inconvenience or discomfort you experienced during your trip.As we can see, the ride was on time. As per our terms and conditions, unfortunately no refund is possible in this case. Furthermore, other passengers have boarded on time at the same stop as indicated on your ticket. Please note that, as per our T&Cs: ""The reimbursement can be requested for reasons which are the responsibility of FlixBus such as delay >120 minutes and the passenger withdraws from the trip, cancellations, which means that only in such cases the refund can be claimed."" Please note that rescheduling the ticket is also not possible.Based on our Terms and Conditions, we cannot offer you a refund of your ticket once the ride has taken place.Please check the information on this link, as per our T&C, which states:13.2.5 A refund will not be given if the passenger did not travel or the seat was allocated or purchased free of charge.You can find the policy here: --here was a link to policy--For future reference, please keep in mind that you can change or cancel the ride details up to 15 minutes before departure via Manage My Booking.We regret we cannot meet your request this time. We would appreciate the opportunity to convince you of our reliability and therefore hope to have you aboard.Kind Regards,Leonita from FlixBus""I have a few comments to this load on BS. I have NO IDEA if the bus was on time or not, because it NEVER ARRIVED AT THE CORRECT PLACE. To board the bus you must not only be on time, but also AT THE CORRECT MEETING POINT. I was on time and at ANNOUNCED, as you mentioned in your ticket (quote: ""Please pay attention to station statements.""), boarding point. And you failed, miserably, to get your part of the service - get the bus to the ANNOUNCED point, as agreed in terms of service (the ticket).Can you imagine this at an airport or train station? Maybe in Africa, not EU.2. ""Other passengers"" argument is so weak for a number of reasons. A. I don't know if there were any. B. Even if they were, they might have prior experience of such misbehavior. C. It does not change THE AGREEMENT with me, personally, to be at certain point at certain time.When I asked customer support ""What platform was announced"" I got answer, that ""the bus is riding and i can give you it's location"" - not answering my question, don't you think? And to the question ""What platform did the bus go to?"" I got the answer ""It's always first platform"", when i inquired ""How is this first platform marked?"" I got the answer, that ""the bus is riding and i can give you it's location"".",1,DE,2024-09-02,Trustpilot

Roma-Firenze ,"Took a Flix bus N815 from Victoria coach station to Brussels on 22nd August. Bus meant to lewve at 21:00 did not leave until 22:15 Got to Lille, driver asked all passengers going to Brussels to come off. I was going to Gare du North. Getting a connecting bus was an issue. All other drivers refused to take because I was not meant to come off at Lille. So didn't have a connecting ticket from London Victoria-Lille- Brussels Gare du North. Don't understand why I was asked to come off in the first place.Eventually got there. On my return on 26th August, bus delayed for 25 minutes. Instead of 23:35 bus came at 00:00. Got to Victoria at 10:15, missed connecting bus 9:15 to Reading. Was told next bus will be 2pm. No apologies for either of the drivers for outbound nor customer service staff. Very rude staff. Had to wait at Victoria from 10:30, was told 2pm, then later told next bus will be 7:30 pm to get to Reading. That's if the bus for Reading comes on time.Will never recommend such a service to anyone, not even my my dog. Such a useless service. No respect not regard for customers. Extremely appalling bus service. No one should ever waste their precious time taking Flix bus. I will be on social media to share my experience. Horrible experience, disgusting customer  service. Was even trying to for assistance to customer rep, who stumped off because another passer was trying to get some information.Utterly disgusting service. I regret using it. Ended up finding my way home by buying ticket with National Express, rather travelling all night and getting to Victoria at 10:15am and be told, I 've missed connecting bus, becuase we left Brussels late and next bus is 7:30pm.Thank God, I got home safe and sound.

Lige nu f.eks. Er bussen 1 og 36 min forsinket og appen bliver ved med at p√•l√¶gge yderligere minutter. I virkeligheden tror jeg de spiller p√• at hvis de bliver ved med at skrive den er forsinket s√• beh√∏ver de ikke at aflyse afgangen og betale penge tilbage, men kan i stedet str√¶kke den s√• langt s√• den bus man i virkeligheden kommer med blot er den n√¶ste afgang.

I don't speak Portuguese but two of the FlixBus people helped me and then suggested I wait for the returning bus to arrive as it may have the backpack. The Driver was amazing and although he had to make a phone call as he had already reported the bag as being left, I was able to retrieve it - I swear it would not go that way in the U.S.; I'd have to wait until I returned to get the backpack.  It had everything in it. I'm so grateful to the Driver for being so kind in spite of having a tight schedule, he was willing to be of service.  You're fortunate to have him on your team.

Great process,"This was my return trip from Seattle to Portland.  Bus over 30 minutes late from Spokane.  Company doesn't seem to calculate Mariners' game day traffic. Trip took 4.5 hours, train beat us into the Portland station.  Newer driver (I can understand why they're quitting) went to Departures at Sea-Tac instead of Arrivals.  No app or company employee notified of a driver not picking up a dozen people last Friday.  By now we're running an hour late. Toured Tacoma and Olympia trying to find the stops.  Glitches with the ticketing process for several riders, which caused more delays.  Now we're 1.5 hours late.  Arrived in Portland at 10:00 p.m.  The train arrived before us. Bus hadn't been cleaned. Litter shoved into crevices. There was a sharp metal lever (broken seat adjuster?) jammed into my thigh. Unable to sleep with the discomfort.

Highly recommend Flixbus. Our Flixbus left Montreal on time,"(maj le 02.09.24, ""Trait√©"" = r√©pondre √† mon email en accusant reception, en r√©it√©rant son engagement verbal pour le confort, sans autres mesures concr√®tes ni explication)J'ai vraiment un avis mitig√© sur Flixbus.Ma derni√®re exp√©rience remonte √† samedi 24/08 au soir.D√©part √† 18h10 de B√©ziers pour terminus √† Toulouse, pour 2h30 environ de voyage : Le car √©tait au top, spacieux, propre, clim fonctionnel, toilettes, et un chauffeur agr√©able.Puis √† 22h25 d√©part de Toulouse pour Bercy, pour environ 10h de route. Alors l√†, c'est la douche froide : on passe sur un voyage de nuit, et l'espace entre les si√®ges est r√©duit, la clim n'est pas vraiment fonctionnelle ! Les chauffeurs sont agr√©ables, mais ne peuvent pas transformer le car qu'on leur a refourgu√©.J'ai eu la mauvaise id√©e de m'asseoir DANS LE FOND du bus, pr√®s du moteur, avec une clim inexistante. J'ai commenc√© la soir√©e... √† avoir chaud. Dans le bus 28¬∞, √† l'ext√©rieur 20¬∞, et impossible de garder la fen√™tre ouverte car certaines personnes ne supportaient pas les courants d'airs. Le bus est plein, nous √©tions 4, pas possible de changer de place.Je me suis r√©solue √† dormir, c'√©tait dur. Je me suis r√©veill√©e plusieurs fois, dans les virages que je sentais et de douleurs au cou car j'avais fini par m'endormir dans une position incroyable.Du coup, j'ai pass√© UNE SALE NUIT. Je peux vous dire que pour la plupart, dans le fond, on supportait notre sort. J'avais l'impression d'√™tre dans une boite de conserve avec tous ces autres humains.Alors qu'on s'arr√™te dans une station essence, on voit un autre car √† c√¥t√© de nous, en voyage de nuit, dans un car digne de ce nom... Mince :( j'aurais voulu √™tre √† leur place.Voici les r√©flexions que je me suis faite :- Pourquoi faites vous les voyages de nuit dans des cars avec des conditions si peu confortables ?Il faudrait √† minima : la clim et un espace suffisant pour les jambes car nous sommes cens√©s y dormir au moins un peu.- Si cela n'est pas possible, peut √™tre r√©duire le nombre de passagers lorsque le car offre des dimensions d'assise r√©duite (car on parle quand m√™me de 10h de voyage !!)Sinon, je trouve que le fait que les toilettes ne soient pas sur le car, c'est ok, si le chauffeur s'arr√™te toutes les 2h.Voil√† √† c√¥t√© de √ßa :J'ai pris 3 bus flix bus entre le 19.08 et le 24.08,les 3 bus se sont pr√©sent√©s, √† l'heure.Prendre une prise secteur √©tait INUTILE, il faut prendre un fil USB.J'ai bien r√©ussi √† charger sur mes 3 trajets.Il n'y a pas eu de vols sur mes 3 trajets o√π je n'en ai pas eu connaissance.",5,SI,2024-08-30,Trustpilot

Altogether a pleasant experience,"While traveling with Flix Bus I must say was very convenient to go from Fort Myers, FL. to Fort Lauderdale,FL. But please watch your luggage if going on a vacation.  We were told by the driver to just leave our luggage by the middle Bin of the bus and they would load the luggage for us.  We did as we were told and proceeded to the sit in our seats.  When we arrived in Fort Lauderdale to go on a cruise there was no luggage, it never made it on the bus it was stolen from Edison Mall where we met the bus.  Now when we got back from our cruise please remember all we had was what we were wearing which was shorts and a tee shirt, Flix bus wouldn't even talk to us.  So please don't let this happen to you watch your possessions at all times. I would also like to add that my friend and I are Senior Citizens (81 and 86), I have to ask  would you still go on a 4 day cruise with one pair of shorts and a tee shirt?????",5,HR,2024-08-30,Trustpilot

Todo muy bien,"Dear Flexi Bus Customer Support,I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding a distressing incident that occurred during my recent journey with Flexi bus.At the Crowfoot stop while the bus was stationary, the driver racially and mentally harassed me and my entire family in front of other passengers. What made the situation even more appalling was when he threatened to kick us off the bus, including my one-year-old child, creating an incredibly hostile and unsafe environment. Such behavior is not only unprofessional and discriminatory but also a clear violation of basic human rights. I am deeply concerned about the well-being and safety of my family during what should have been a simple journey. Given the seriousness of this incident, I am currently exploring my legal options, including filing a formal complaint with the Canada Human Rights Commission. I urge you to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action against the driver involved. I also expect a written response outlining the steps Flexi Bus will take to address this issue and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter.",5,GB,2024-08-30,Trustpilot

I then had to drive and get my son.I just see that FlixBus replied stating that they did what was allowed, however on their website it states that children between the ages of 10-15 can travel alone with permission from the parent (that you click when you book the ticket).

Never again. So bad. ,"Dopo aver usato Flixbus diverse volte, posso dire che la qualit√† del servizio offerto √® molto irregolare. I ritardi ingenti non sono rari e, al contrario delle compagnie ferroviarie, non viene offerto alcun indennizzo a seguito di un ritardo, a prescindere dalla causa.Per avere un rimborso a causa di ritardi, infatti, √® necessario non salire sul mezzo, rinunciando al servizio..Oggi, con il bus 522 sono arrivata a destinazione con oltre un'ora di ritardo. Come gi√† capitato altre volte, il ritardo, accumulatosi nel tratto precedente alla mia stazione, non √® stato comunicato se non dopo lo scadere dell'orario d'arrivo previsto. Durante il viaggio, poi, vi √® stata una sosta durata ben 45 minuti all'autogrill. Magari si sarebbe potuta restringere la pausa/sosta per riguadagnare del tempo, invece che fermarsi cos√¨ tanto..?Infine, il bagno presente sul mezzo era in condizioni vomitevoli.Chi intende avere un servizio affidabile pu√≤ quindi guardare altrove, per evitare di avere esperienze infernali. Per le grandi tratte i treni sono pi√π affidabili, e se ci sono compagnie su strada con una qualit√† costante e prezzi giusti rispetto al servizio offerto, questa non √® FlixBus.",1,US,2024-08-29,Trustpilot

Rigtig god tur,"Yes, there is a ""Terms and Condition"" that everyone has to consider when it comes to choosing FlixBus. I chose Flixbus because 1. Due to limit income for travel 2. There is also limit choices in order to go from KY to OH. However, despite there is a fact there is ""Terms and Conditions"", I do not apologize for the choices I made. Thanks to this experience, it has opened my eyes over how a company like this runs and treats their customers (or passengers). This is something I hope that anyone who reads this can learn from as well. Since I agreed with the ""Terms and Conditions"", I will have to accept that I will not ever receive my nearly $100 back (nonrefundable), and various people who work for and/or with the company their ""policies"" or actions as well. I do appreciate and much respect for Baron's bus service though. They are all about making sure their passengers feel as though they are royalty. This is something (in my opinion) other bus companies can learn from, over how Baron runs their business. I much respect for Baron. I do not appreciate how many times whether I tried to come in contact with Flixbus, the store I purchased my ticket, or anyone related, I was made to feel everything is my fault. If I had a bus ticket to be cancelled which cost me nearly $100, and I purchased it by cash because my card will not accept a bus ticket purchase. I was made to feel it was my fault and I have to accept a voucher and lost of money. When I was unaware the inaccuracy of my bus route from Columbus, OH to Louisville, KY and got left for not arriving on the ""correct"" time, it was my fault. Despite the fact I am not the one who runs FlixBus and was not told by anyone until I made it to the Columbus, OH bus stop, which was very unclean and very tiny. The staff there however, were very sweet. When I made it to the Daytona, OH bus station, the bus driver and manager there complained it was my fault for being unaware of the inaccuracy of the bus route. I was told I should contact Customer Service, well, the lady over Columbus, OH station did that for me because she understood I was unaware. Again, I was unaware there was a flaw and felt I should not have to call over something that I expected by the bus company (or FlixBus) to had made sure everything was accurate for passengers. So, I guess I am suppose to call over all my bus route tickets before going on my trip(s). ",5,IT,2024-08-29,Trustpilot

It was easy,"This was my first experience with FlixBus and will be my last. It was absolutely awful in every respect. There is not a single thing this company does well and, most importantly, they don't fix mistakes and have designed a website to prevent the customer getting refunds and compensation. Specifically:1) I made booking;2) FlixBus unilaterally, and without explanation, changed the bus I was on to one that departed an hour later;3) I had deliberately booked row 1 in order to have a view;4) They moved me and my + 1 to row 6;5) I paid a premium for row 1 and it was not refunded;6) The WiFi did not work on the bus;7) I AM ASKING FOR A REFUND OF THE ROW 1 PREMIUM SINCE THE PRODUCT WAS NOT DELIVERED. I AM ASKING FOR A REFUND OF 50% OF THE PAID FARE FOR THE NON-FUNCTIONAL WIFI.This should be reimbursed to my credit card. Not a travel credit as that would be useless. I do not plan to travel on Flixbus again.Update Sept. 5th, 2024: The private correspondance referred to by Flixbus in their reply acknowledged the refund for premium seats. However, the they did not take responsibility for their non-functioning WiFi, or for unilaterally and inexplicably changing the scheduled bus that I was on.

Few minutes after the border control the bus stop and turned off because the engine overheated . the driver managed to get us to a gas station where we waited for a mechanics who did not come until 10pm. we were then able to continue with the trip but then at 1am again we had to stop because smoke was coming from the engine. the driver managed to get us to saratoga spring where we were told at 1:30 am that a replacemnt bus would come in 2 hours. we received an email from flixbus letting us know that a bus was on it way but an hour later the driver was notified that a bus was coming from new york and will get there a 6;30 am . it came close to 7 am we di not get to New york until 10:40 m causing me to have to miss work and my friend to lose her ticket for DC scheduled at 7:45 am on 8/19.this is what I was repeatedly told:""I'm so sorry to hear that about what happened regarding to your trip.Please be informed that if you took the trip we can no longer give you any compensation and that's our terms and conditions.I understand, but I'm so sorry, we are just following to our terms and conditions.We dont give any exception. I'm so sorry, but there is nothing we can do, because we are just following to our terms and conditions.""I was not asking for a full refund but compensation for the almost 7hours of wait they put us through. and some people had to get on a flight in New York which they missed.",5,US,2024-08-28,Trustpilot

Great experience,"I used Flixbus for two journeys, the second of which was fine and would have got a good review. The first journey however was poor. There were two drivers on the service. One driver was calm and polite. The second one became angry and aggressive when we tried to find out if we needed to stay on the bus or take a connection. He was in a rush, partly because he had taken an unnecessary long break just before a border crossing which meant impacted the length of time it took to do the crossing by a few hours. Thankfully, my fellow passengers and I ignored his aggression and didn‚Äôt react to it or respond accordingly.  If we had not restrained then it could have been ugly.",5,PT,2024-08-28,Trustpilot

Durante la espera pregunte a un conductor de otra l√≠nea de flixbus que hab√≠a en la estaci√≥n, y me dijo tranquilamente que la respuesta cuesta dinero. Escrib√≠ a atenci√≥n al cliente, y me encontr√© con que estaba cerrado porque era domingo. Al final no tuve m√°s remedio que comprar yo otro billete. He reclamado el reembolso de ese importe, y no solamente no he obtenido respuesta, es que ni siquiera me han dado un resguardo de la reclamaci√≥n que present√©, por lo que no tengo la posibilidad de hacer un seguimiento de la misma. Es decir, pierdes la conexi√≥n por retraso en uno de sus autobuses, no te solucionan el problema, si pides informaci√≥n a alguno de sus conductores intenta sacarte dinero para d√°rtela, y al final te toca pagar dos veces el mismo recorrido.

However, after two weeks, I received the message that the lost and found department couldn‚Äôt locate my phone. This surprised me, as the bus driver had confirmed having it.Inadequate Customer Service: I also reached out to FlixBus customer service, but their response has been insufficient. It‚Äôs frustrating that they can‚Äôt assist me despite having onboard surveillance cameras.Similar Experiences: I‚Äôve heard similar stories from friends who never got their lost baggage back from FlixBus. This raises concerns and affects my trust in the company.I hope that those reading this take it seriously and consider improving their handling of lost items.

DO NOT travel with them,"In general all is good: the buses depart and arrive in time, it's comfortable and clean, but one driver and his service was a total disappointment.I had a trip from Belgium (Bruges) to Germany (K√∂ln/Bonn Airport). At the beginning the driver seemed friendly, but not so talkative, it was ok. But then, when the bis stopped at one station, I started to feel badly unexpectedly and wanted to take my medicine ASAP. The driver let me do this and I tried to do it as fast as possible, trying to put the luggage back in a normal way and with no bothering other passengers. But he... Started to yell at me like crazy in Czech (the language I don't know), started to throw my luggage and carry it like it's a rubbish when trying to put it back. I have no idea what he said, but some words I've heard and know were about my stupidity and personality.Dude, I respect your job. Being a driver is difficult, especially the journey for more than 6 hours almost unstoppably, but I'm paying not for being yelled at me using a language I don't know and among a crowd for sure, and especially when I feel badly. If you can't be patient and stress resistant - change your job and go to a mental hospital. That was disappointing, horrible, impolite and with the absence of an elementary respect. For the comfort of the bus, timing - very good. For the driver I'd say -100, but it's impossible here. I wish the driver to be more polite, respectful and lots of improvements.

We stayed at the bus station to figure out what to do next. Thanks to God we stayed at the bus station and after 30 min (late) another bus came. I understand buses get delayed, etc. The problem was that FlixBux did not send any information about the bus being delayed. When you make a reservation you give them your email and phone#.

There is alot of noise inside the bus,"I traveled today at 7.30AM on route from Zadar to Rijeka. It was a horrible old bus Knezevic company operating under Flixbus. The air conditioning was not working properly, it was hot and smelly of people sweating. The application for booking lets you choose your seat, I had assigned seat however driver told us to seat anywhere?! We almost got involved in an accident and the bus arrived with 10 minutes delay even though there was no traffic at all along the whole route. My previous experiences with Flixbus were very positive, so this was very unexpected and disappointing. Flixbus should make sure that the buses that operate under their name are up to certain standard.

No bus station open in Seattle- no‚Ä¶,"Die Hinreise nach M√ºnchen war okay, bis auf einen kleinen Zwischenfall bei dem es fast einen Auffahrunfall gab (Flixbus in PW). Wir sind p√ºnktlich abgefahren und angekommen. Auf der R√ºckreise hatte das Fahrzeug einen Motorschaden und wir warteten 1H auf einer Rastst√§tte, der Fahrer hat irgendwas rumgeh√§mmert und weiter ging es. Nach knapp 30 Minuten mussten wir jedoch an der Rastst√§tte Bodensee anhalten, da die Weiterfahrt nicht mehr m√∂glich war. Wir erhielten eine SMS von Flixbus, wir sollen doch bitte, wenn m√∂glich, mit dem √∂V weiterfahren (von einer Rastst√§tte aus....), die Kosten werden √ºbernommen. Dies aus dem Grund, weil der Ersatzbus, welcher aus Winterthur zum Bodensee fahren musste, nicht genug Sitzpl√§tze f√ºr alle Passagiere hatte. Der Fahrer konnte so schlecht Deutsch, dass wir mit seinem Telefon mit Flixbus CH kommunizieren mussten. Nach 2.5H kam der Ersatzbus (es hiess es ginge 1h bis der Bus da ist). Da der Ersatzfahrer lange unterwegs war, mussten wir nach 1H Fahrzeit 30 Minuten Pause einlegen. Mit 4.5H Versp√§tung in Z√ºrich angekommen.Flixbus zahlt keine R√ºckerstattung der R√ºckreise, da der Bus nicht mit 120 Minuten Versp√§tung abgefahren ist.

Good overall,"DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY if you value being able to speak to someone if anything out of the ordinary arises or you need a refund for any reason.  There is essentially no customer service - a computer will generate general responses. When you inquire to speak to a supervisor or someone else, you will be disconnected from your chat. When you try to re-enter chat to speak to someone else, you will automatically be disconnected. Thus, you will have NO WAY to get your situation resolved - leaving you feeling utterly frustrated and upset.  You just have to resolve to losing your money, your time, connecting reservations, etc. It‚Äôs a nightmare. This company just recently, a few months ago, made a policy change that now requires lap children to travel with a car seat or harness. Please note this is NOT a nation wide change (Portugal). Other bus companies still allow for 3 and under to travel by lap. So you will not know to look for change if you don‚Äôt know one has taken place.  When booking, no flag or notice is given for this change in policy on your ticket or when you enter the child‚Äôs age. Thus, we did not find out about this change until we were displaying our tickets to board. Of course, we were refused boarding and stranded. We tried to get a refund or a voucher for that and future booked trips- all to no avail. Utter thieves. ",5,PT,2024-08-20,Trustpilot

No water in the toilet,"Oggetto: Richiesta di Rimborso e Reclamo per Disservizio ‚Äì Viaggio del 14/08/2024 Gentile Servizio Clienti FlixBus,Mi rivolgo a voi per segnalare un grave disservizio accaduto durante il mio recente viaggio con FlixBus, che ha fortemente compromesso la mia esperienza.Dopo un viaggio iniziale senza problemi, durante il secondo tratto del mio viaggio da Bologna a Torino, ho dovuto affrontare una situazione estremamente spiacevole. Dopo una lunga attesa di 1 ora e 20 minuti presso la stazione di Bologna, mi sono ritrovata a dover aspettare da sola in un ambiente poco sicuro per una donna sola.In seguito, durante la sosta in un autogrill vicino Torino, il vostro autobus √® ripartito senza di me, nonostante le mie valigie fossero ancora a bordo e la mia prenotazione in corso. Questo √® avvenuto perch√© ero impegnata a sollecitare il personale dell'autogrill per ottenere rapidamente il mio pasto da portare via. Nessun controllo √® stato effettuato per verificare che tutti i passeggeri fossero presenti prima di ripartire, il che ha causato un grande disagio e una situazione di pericolo per me.Fortunatamente, alcune persone gentili mi hanno aiutata a raggiungere Aosta, dove la polizia ferroviaria mi ha assistito. Tuttavia, questa √® stata un'esperienza tremenda, soprattutto perch√© non conoscevo la zona e vengo da fuori.Considerata la gravit√† della situazione e il disagio causato, richiedo immediatamente un rimborso per il viaggio in questione. Ritengo che quanto accaduto sia inaccettabile e spero in una pronta risoluzione del problema.Resto in attesa di un vostro riscontro al pi√π presto.Cordiali saluti Elisa Catalano.Nr.prenotazione 3186174813",1,NO,2024-08-23,Trustpilot

We were at the train station early, and found our gate.  No bus ever came as the gate had changed unbeknown to us.  There were other travellers who missed as well.  The customer service rep at the station was extremely rude about the situation once we missed and of zero help to get us to our destination. We ended up booking a train.  When we got home and reached out to their customer service, again they were zero help and rude.  Save your money and the headache of this horrible company. Reply:  We did keep an eye on the board and as well I had the app open on my phone.  You will never see us on another bus with you and I will encourage others of the same.

The trip went well,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! FlixBus in Croatia respects ""no schedule and no reservation"".We¬¥ve booked a round trip to Zadar, as we had tickets for a Plitvice excursion planned. For the morning trip, we¬¥ve got a message within the last 10 minutes prior the bus arrival, that ""the bus has 69 minutes delay""... we had time, so we¬¥ve returned home hopping the bus will finally come, even with that delay. After an hour, I¬¥ve checked their website, and the delay time increased. Reason for which, we took a taxi, as otherwise we would have lost the Plitvice trip. At the return, the bus was again delayed (this time no information received), and it stopped in a different location as the one confirmed at the purchase. TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL!After several attempts to contact customer support via chat (their Croatian phone number sounds as ""invalid""), they¬¥ve said that after checking the system we appear as ""boarded"", and given this, even if the 102 Minutes delay, they are not able to process any refund... and apparently their policy is to refund only in case of +120 Minutes delays. Really?? Why do they have the online booking & reservation option then??In response to your feedback (as apparently I have no response option):1) nobody contacted me directly! I¬¥ve did that! Talking several times, with several agents, with no solution! Your contact number was actually ""invalid"" (and would have been also on MY MONEY!).2) your policy is S**T and UNFARE - just saying ""we are sorry"" is not a solution! Question: who is returning me MY MONEY, just because your bus came after 1.5 H, and I didn¬¥t needed it anymore??THANKS FOR NOTHING! AND NOT RECOMMENDING YOU!",4,IE,2024-08-18,Trustpilot

The bus driver said seats were not assigned and we can sit anywhere we want. We explicitly stated we purchased tickets with assigned seats, he said it didn't matter.

Please sit in your assigned seat, or you might be asked to move. If no seat number is indicated, you can choose a free seat marked with a green sticker."" All kinds of people ride this bus and not everyone wants to understand the FlixBus trip reservations. Very important: bus drivers need to be educated about the types of reservations.

Such behavior is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the overall service provided by the bus company. Customers should be able to rely on their confirmed reservations and expect a certain level of respect and service quality.I hope that the bus company addresses this issue and ensures that such incidents do not occur in the future, as it significantly impacts the passenger experience. Additionally, I urge the company to train their staff on customer service and handle reservations more effectively to prevent similar situations from happening again.Thank you for taking the time to address this matter and I hope for an improvement in the service quality on this bus route.Sincerely,Mira Mis",5,SA,2024-08-16,Trustpilot

Bus was late and customer service‚Ä¶,"First of all, the bus arrived late. It is understandable under any circumstances, but an up to date notice would not be so bad. Whenever we check the internet the estimated arrival, it shows only 7 minutes late. Wherein fact the bus arrived approximately 30minutes late. Secondly the conductor was rude.  One of the passenger wanted to use the comfort room before departure but it was locked. It is understandable to preserve the toilet for the ride. The conductor was just completely rude, he angrily responded by pointing the toilet outside and didn't even bothered to say a single word. He could have said it properly and politely. Third the aircondition is almost turned off the entire ride. It is summer, the weather was hot outside the bus, but even hotter inside the bus due to the aircondition barely turned on. We were sweating the entire ride, some of the passengers are coughing due to lack of air inside the bus. It was really uncomfortable for all of us, especially for my pregnant wife with me. Lastly, the toilet stinks. Our sits were next to the toilet, we can smell the toilet stinking even though the door was shut. It might have been nice to have it cleaned once or twice during the ride. Or maybe atleast leave a cleaning material or air cleanser inside. Some passenger would have gladly done it themselves, if only the materials left inside the toilet. I had previous trips using FlixBus, this experience was the worst I ever had.",1,ES,2024-08-14,Trustpilot

Pontuality,"Vorrei condividere la mia pessima esperienza con FlixBus, un servizio che si √® rivelato del tutto inaffidabile e poco professionale. Ecco i dettagli del mio viaggio:Il mio autobus doveva partire alle 09:00 dal punto di incontro presso The Florida Mall. The Florida Mall, che √® enormemente vasto, e il nostro autista Uber ci ha lasciato all‚Äôesterno del complesso. Senza una chiara comprensione delle distanze all‚Äôinterno del mall, abbiamo impiegato 10 minuti per raggiungere il punto di incontro, solo per scoprire che l‚Äôautobus ci era appena passato davanti. Nonostante fossi arrivato alle 08:50, l‚Äôautobus √® partito senza di noi. Mi trovavo l√¨ con tutta la mia famiglia, inclusi due bambini piccoli, e abbiamo attraversato tutto il mall con i bagagli, arrivando alle 09:01, solo per vedere l‚Äôautobus partire sotto i nostri occhi.Ho provato a chiamare l‚Äôautista, ma ha ignorato le mie chiamate. √à inaccettabile che un autista non faccia il minimo sforzo per accertarsi che tutti i passeggeri siano a bordo, soprattutto considerando che avevo solo un minuto di ritardo.Ho contattato immediatamente la sede di FlixBus chiedendo di cambiare il biglietto con il prossimo autobus, il quale era praticamente vuoto. Tuttavia, mi √® stato negato il cambio. Di conseguenza, ho dovuto acquistare un secondo biglietto al costo esorbitante di 47$, quasi il doppio rispetto ai 24$ che avevo pagato per il primo biglietto. Questo √® un vero e proprio furto, considerando le circostanze.L‚Äôintera esperienza √® stata estremamente frustrante e stressante per me e la mia famiglia.Come se non bastasse, ho chiesto infine il rimborso per il biglietto non usufruito visto che non avevo viaggiato e mi √® stato negato. Questo √® prendere a calci la propria clientela ed ecco perch√© i loro autobus sono vuoti!FlixBus ha mostrato una totale mancanza di comprensione e flessibilit√†. Non consiglio assolutamente questo servizio a nessuno. La loro mancanza di professionalit√† e la loro politica rigidissima hanno causato un disagio enorme a me e alla mia famiglia.Consigli per migliorare:Flessibilit√† nelle politiche di cambio biglietto: Consentire il cambio biglietto, specialmente quando il prossimo autobus √® praticamente vuoto, mostrerebbe maggiore attenzione alle esigenze dei clienti.Formazione degli autisti: Gli autisti dovrebbero essere formati per essere pi√π comprensivi e disponibili nei confronti dei passeggeri, fermandosi per pochi minuti in caso di piccoli ritardi.Politiche di rimborso pi√π eque: Offrire il rimborso per i biglietti non utilizzati quando il passeggero non riesce a salire sull‚Äôautobus per motivi ragionevoli aumenterebbe la fiducia nel servizio.Migliore segnaletica e comunicazione: Fornire indicazioni chiare sui punti di incontro all‚Äôinterno di complessi vasti come The Florida Mall aiuterebbe i turisti e coloro che non conoscono la zona a orientarsi meglio e ad arrivare in tempo.",5,NL,2024-08-13,Trustpilot
Com FlixBus a melhor op√ß√£o para concursos p√∫blicos e viagens.,"We have previously travelled on Flix buses without any issue, but a couple of weeks ago, that sadly changed.  Our bus from Perth to Glasgow had broken down in the depot and the driver told us that nothing could be done - it would need to be repaired and we would either (I) have to wait 2 hours for the next Flix bus or (II) go and arrange alternative transport.  He was very apologetic and also said Flix would refund us, if we applied online for the refund.My son and I then had to rush across the depot and luckily found a bus leaving for Glasgow run by another company.  BUT when I went online to secure my Flix refund, they flat refused!  Not once but twice, even when I explained we had been told by the driver to go and make alternative arrangements!  So essentially they took our money and kept it, despite not providing the service.  Appalling treatment of customers and I won't be travelling with them again.",5,CH,2024-08-13,Trustpilot

At that moment it was 9.50 we had to be there at 9.55 to start our bus ride at 10.10.

I just didn‚Äôt get why he didn‚Äôt do his job by telling the passenger to move to another seat because it was my seat . so paying for a seat doesn‚Äôt matter because when you get on the bus, no telling if your seat will be taken, and you will have to find somewhere else to sit and hopefully you don‚Äôt sit in someone else because it was like I was playing musical chairs I end up sitting in someone else and I actually moved because I understand the problem and I told them that I had a seat in the front of the bus and someone sitting in my seat so I just moved so it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem ",2,US,2024-08-12,Trustpilot

On time,"My experience was negative. I had a trip from Vienna to Karlovy Vary with a transfer in Prague. About 20 kilometers before Prague, the bus broke down, and the driver said that we would have to wait for another bus to come, which could take an unknown amount of time‚Äîmaybe 2 hours, maybe longer. He couldn't provide any other information, and I had a connecting bus an hour later, so we were supposed to arrive in Prague at 1:00 PM, and my connecting bus was at 2:00 PM. Obviously, after the bus broke down, there was no chance of making it to the other bus on time. Fortunately, I was able to figure something out‚ÄîI called a taxi, paid as much as the ticket cost altogether, and made it to the bus station in Prague in time for the next bus. As for the other people on the broken-down bus, I don't know what happened to them. It was a full bus, and it seemed like they all missed wherever they needed to go.",5,DK,2024-08-12,Trustpilot

I didn‚Äòt see any option for the passenger in the aisle seat to charge a device. In the past another passenger stole part of my luggage so this continues to be a sincere concern of mine. In many other countries I have seen people receiving a ticket number for their luggage and at arrival the the busdriver compares the ticket number to the actual piece of luggage before surrendering it to the passenger. I personally find this a practical option to avoid potentially loosing luggage. In my case this would allow for a much more relaxed journey.

Reserved seats aren't reserved,"A terrible experience. Driver appeared clueless. At one point, she missed the off-highway Port Perry scheduled stop...causing her to exit the highway...figure it out...and then travel back NORTH to the scheduled Port Perry stop. No announcement, no explanation was ever provided by the driver as to why we were now headed back north on the highway. In addition, she always signaled lane changes at the last moment, which caused additional delay and potential hazards. Weather conditions were ideal--clear sky, bare and dry road conditions as well as minimal vehicular traffic. Complicating matters further....there were NO FLIX SIGNS / STICKERS AT SCHEDULED STOP LOCATIONS INCLUDING SUDBURY ""FOUR CORNERS"" AND ALL OTHERS. This caused confusion and anger among passengers waiting to board an already late bus. At most scheduled stops, I observed passengers waving and/or running toward the bus...after being advised to wait at an unmarked area,,,only to see the bus stopping hundreds of metres away...The journey from Sudbury to Toronto ( Union Station ) was almost SEVEN HOURS !!!!

There is no shelter, few bench seats (up to 40 people were standing at times), no restroom facilities, no vending machines.

Garbage from the first pickup in‚Ä¶,"Good afternoon. I want to tell you the story of how I traveled by your bus from Kyiv to Nice. On 28.07.2024, 40 km from Venice, the bus driver drove on without me. All my luggage was left on the bus. I ran after the bus, waving my hands, but in vain: the driver was a true professional, so he did everything to avoid me. I called a taxi and got to Venice for only 140 euros. From Venice, I took another one of your buses to Bergamo, where I rented a car and started to catch up with my bus #456.  I caught up with it in Nice. My bus was late the whole route, and arrived in Nice much earlier, but I was already waiting for it. My luggage, which was in the luggage compartment, was not stolen from me, so I took it back. They managed to steal the luggage that was directly on the bus. I am almost certain that leaving me at a gas station before Venice and stealing my luggage was not an accident. When I got off at that  stop before Venice, the driver saw me up close, he couldn't have forgotten it.  There were other drivers in Nice.  One of them behaved arrogantly, said it was my fault that I was behind and that my belongings had been stolen, refused to open the luggage compartment and show me, then told his partner to just close the door and drive, and this was half an hour ahead of schedule.  I can confidently say that if I hadn't caught up with the bus in Nice in a rented car, my luggage would have been stolen from the luggage compartment as well, they just didn't know where it was. All this happened in the presence of other bus passengers. I feel extremely negative emotions from the actions of your drivers, they are wrong, arrogant, impudent and dishonest. It was very treacherous, ugly, stupid, and brazen. But for some reason I feel ashamed of it, because there were people around. If those who work with complaints in your company are not like that, I hope that the right conclusions will be drawn.  Stolen items: 1) brown Burberry glasses in a branded case; 2) a Leathermann multitool in a black leather case; 3) two chargers (cord + plug); 4) a new in the box power bank 30000; 5) a small black backpack; 6) water, a light beige comb, a pencil, a pen, soap, etc. May those who deliberately left me and stole my things be happy with them. I will definitely write a review about your company. Thank you for your attention",1,DE,2024-08-09,Trustpilot

Dirty washroom,"On Aug 2, 2024, three of us were booked to travel on FlixBus from Western University, Elgin Hall, 1999 University Drive, London, Ontario, to go to Toronto Pearson Airport, arriving 11:45am.  There were two sets of two passengers also waiting on the front steps of the building when we arrived at the front of Elgin Hall for 8:45am.  We all spotted the FlixBus at 9:03am but it went straight down passed us so we thgouht it went to turnaround as it was on the other side of the road.  It did not reappear for 10minutes but when it did, it just passed us and left the university campus.  Stunned all three sets of passengers tried to contact FlixBus agents, but one had a hang up, one could not get through, and I could not find the phone number to reach them on the web easily.My relatives, who were waiting with us, decided to pursue the bus in the hopes of catching it at the downtown London stop.  But we were unsuccessful.  We even tried to catch the bus before it hit the highway but no such luck.  All through this in the car, we were trying to reach a live agent.  When one did come on, she was ignorant, lackadaisical and was not listening to what I described as a crisis.  No one knew why the bus did not pick us up.  The instructions on the front page of the booking just gave the street address 1999 University Drive.  The customer service agent was USELESS and cared more to DEFEND and question me as to why others were picked up at the stop  As I kept telling her, there were 7 passengers stranded in front of the building.   The agent said I could not get a refund on top of it and we had to pay $270 to take an Uber to Toronto airport instead.  After personal research, we found out that the bus goes to the BACK OF THE RESIDENCE BUILDING to pick up its passengers, not the front.  How is one to know this when there are no clear signs or instructions on the booking sheet??  Very very disappointed with FlixBus and regret booking with them - my first and last time.",3,DK,2024-08-08,Trustpilot

But, how did they do it in the first place? They must have ignored my refund request, because the customer service rep made no mention of it.As for my journey there, I'm currently on the bus and the bus driver has taken a 20 minute detour to drop a passenger off.

Mudaram a minha poltrona,"Just today my son was supposed to travel on flixbus from Barrie to Owen sound to come home. He was denied entry to the bus by a very rude bus driver because he didn't have ID. Nowhere on the bus ticket or the confirmation email did it mention that he required ID.  So he was left on the side of the road. When I contacted flixbus the first person I spoke to hung up on me. The next person I spoke to told me ""in the terms and conditions on their website it states that every passenger must have ID"". I don't know anyone that reads all terms and conditions before they purchase a product. He then told me that as a result there is nothing he can do, he can't even refund the ticket. I wonder how many customers they leave at the side of the road if they don't have ID? I wonder if they are able to sell more than one ticket for every seat this way?When I demanded that they transfer me to someone who can address this potentially very unsafe practice, he then hung up on me. This could have been potentially very unsafe leaving a child on the side of the road. Not to mention the corrupt business practice of selling a ticket and then denying entry.",4,IT,2024-08-08,Trustpilot
"Bus arrived late, rude Conductor, no aircondition, toilet stinks. ","Bus 2702 departing Hamilton from King and Dundurn on July 31 - I had contacted FlixBus‚Äôs chat support the day prior to this departure in order to confirm my hesitation with regards to where their app was telling me to wait for my bus. When I opened the Google pin it told me to wait out front of a gas station with no shelter or bus stop signage. The chat support agent told me repeatedly that this was indeed the correct spot to wait and I should expect to find my bus stopping there and NOT at the actual bus stop that was on the opposite side of the 4-way intersection. When I arrived there the bus was over 15 minutes late I tried calling them and the person just repeated what I could already see on the app. I told her the ‚Äúreal time location‚Äù data wasn‚Äôt showing me where the bus was and she couldn‚Äôt confirm my bus‚Äôs location either. A few minutes later I see the bus on the opposite side of the street and I run through traffic to try and catch it. When I made it I said to the driver that I was told repeatedly by the company to wait over there and the only thing he could tell me was that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not wrong but it‚Äôs illegal to park there so I stop here‚Äù i was still angry but I got on the bus because I was hot and sweaty. I must have dropped my drink near the front of the bus because I couldn‚Äôt find it. Once I arrived at my destination I saw my drink in the driver‚Äôs cup holder and thought he was just holding onto it until the right passenger (me) saw it and took it back but when I went to pick it up it was nearly empty!! I was shocked because I had already opened the drink and took a few drinks out it already. Bus 2701 from Downtown London to Hamilton (Mc Master) - This experience was even worse than the first one!! My bus was originally supposed to depart at 10:15 and was later delayed by 1.5 hours. I got notification about it though so I wasn‚Äôt too upset at this point. What infuriated me was what happened when I was walking to the place the app was telling me the bus was supposed to pick me up from, which was a random sidewalk in the middle of the worst part of downtown London. I waited there for over 2 hours (one hour because of the notified delay plus an extra hour ontop of that) because of the initial delay. A girl eventually came to the same spot as me with a suitcase and I asked her if she was also waiting for a FlixBus and she said yes she was, so I told her I have been waiting here since 9:45 in the morning and no bus has shown up. I had called customer service and asked them to confirm where I‚Äôm supposed to be standing and where my bus was, and she confirmed that I was in the correct spot and to keep waiting, then she said that she would also call dispatch and try to get the drivers location for me so I knew how long it would be. I never got ahold of her again. I must have called at least 5 times and every time I would be hung up on before being able to talk to anyone. The girl that was with me at that point had called her dad who worked in the area to see if he knew if this was the right spot or not, and he went to go ask his boss who told us that we actually needed to be like 2.5 blocks down the road. When we arrived at this new location there were at least 15 people waiting for a flix bus, some with different bus numbers and destinations than mine. There was no shelter, no updates in the app about where to wait for the bus, no delay updates. I called FlixBus‚Äôs customer service again and dialed in as a safety complaint because at this point I had been waiting for over 3 hours in 35¬∞C weather and was drenched in sweat and feeling light headed, to which someone answered the phone, and as I was explaining everything to him a flix bus shows up!! When I asked him if he was going to Hamilton or not he said he was but he was only taking passengers from his bus number which was 2710 (I was 2701) and I said that‚Äôs ridiculous that you won‚Äôt let me on the bus after this crazy delay in the heat. He said ‚Äúnot my problem, call the company‚Äù and I said I have been and have someone on the line right now and I said to the FlixBus rep ‚Äúare you hearing this right now? He said he‚Äôs not letting me in the bus even though he‚Äôs travelling to my destination‚Äù and after I said that guess what he did? HUNG UP ON ME. I crawled under a bush for relief from the sun because I didn‚Äôt know how much longer I‚Äôd be outside for, and I couldn‚Äôt just leave to find a drink because according to the FlixBus App my bus could be here any second because the departure time still said 11:45am (it was 2:00pm by now, my original departure time was 10:15am), and I couldn‚Äôt get ahold of anyone through customer service and my phone was overheating by this point. My bus came a little after 2:00 pm. It was packed, presumably because they hadn‚Äôt picked up anyone since 6am and the back of the bus reeked of hot stale urine. The wifi didn‚Äôt work either. I also missed school because of the massive delay. I would NEVER recommend FlixBus to anyone. ",1,GB,2024-08-08,Trustpilot

"Took our money, didn't provide the service...","My wife has a disability and is frail. We booked front row seats for our journey but when we got on the seats were occupied. As we were trying to explain to people they were in our reserved seats we were shouted at by the driver to move down the bus. He then set off at speed whilst we were still standing and holding hand luggage. The bus was full. We were thrown about and my wife fell into someone sat down. She has injured her shoulder. The bus then made two unscheduled stops and two people occupying our seats were dropped off. They seemed to know the driver. I therefore conclude that the abusive driver was doing favours for people he knows and giving them our seats and abusing us. Then deliberately setting off to throw us around. So, we paid extra for front row seats but what we got was abuse from the driver, being made to stand up, then thrown around resulting in an injury to my wife. I left feedback with FlixBus 5 days ago and all I have is an automated response. No follow up. They claim on their website that passenger safety is their top priority.

Contacted online support ahead to see if I could bring my bike on a trip. They said I could pay extra for bulky luggage and dismantle it, when I asked for clarity about which parts to dismantle, they sent me the dictionary definition for the word ""dismantle"". 2. Arrived at bus station and ticket clerk was smug and sarcastic about me having a bike, saying things like ""What are you gonna do with that?"" and ""Oh we'll see how that goes."" I explained what online support had said and asked why he had this weird energy, he explained that there were different policies for different regions and instead of an apology he joked that he ""saw conflict in his future."" He said I had to talk to driver and they wouldn't get there until 10 mins before departure.3. I don't get a chance to see driver until 3 mins before departure. As soon as he sees me with a bike he starts yelling ""NO BIKE! NO BIKE! DON'T WASTE MY TIME!"" in front of the huge line behind me. It was embarrassing and when I tried to calmly explain my situation and that I had done as customer support has told, he just kept repeatedly yelling until I left. 4. No option to cancel and get a refund online, all I got was a partial refund. I'm leaving this review and my feedback on a survey to give Flixbus a chance to make this right, but so far this has been the worst customer service experience I've ever had. The fact that I'm bothering to leave a negative review is wild enough, this is the first time I've done this. Update: They added the reply below but have not reached out to me privately to offer any form of refund.

But the return trip. Oh my. Anaheim to San Francisco overnight. 1) My booking was cancelled and I was rebooked on Greyhound at an earlier time - only communication given was an email day of. I would not have chosen this option.2)Greyhound bus was late and reserved seat was taken by someone else. I had to ask them to move.3)Greyhound bus was apparently not direct -  had to unload people and luggage at LA Union Station around 10:30pm. They promised a quick return with a new driver and clean bus. No return. No communication. By 2:30AM I made other arrangements to reach home by Monday morning for work.

On realizing this she called it immediately after the bus had left, and was able to speak with the driver. The driver did confirm that he had the phone and would hand it in to the office in Budapest once he got back there - but it then disappeared. No satisfactory answers since then. And yes, relevant lost and found forms were used on web site etc.",5,BR,2024-08-06,Trustpilot
Awesome! ,"Absolutely horrible experience. I was returning from a funeral of my friend so i was a little in distress and almost forgot my suitcase. I quickly realized, but the bus driver refused to open the bus storage, he said ‚Äútoo bad‚Äù and that i should better fill out the lost and found form. I immediately did. I waited for three weeks and after those, it said that my suitcase was not found. I couldn‚Äôt leave things like that so i personally went to ask three bus drivers on the same route, where do they leave the suitcases. I was told that usually in prague or brno. Since in the suitcase are things after my friend who passed away, I HAD to go and at least ask about it (in person). In prague i was told that they have over 1500 (!!) lost suitcases there and they cannot tell me if mine is there, even if they see it, because the lost and found office said it is lost. Now i am beggining to feel really hopeless, especially because the things had a great emotional value to me. I don‚Äôt know, how someone can be this cruel. Never again.",4,US,2024-08-06,Trustpilot

This was a frustrating and disappointing experience.,"This is mostly an average service, but the drivers are always on their toes. Beyond that, not much to expect. On a recent trip there were zero bath tissues in the rest room at the back of the bus on a 5+ hour journey!! There were no power outlets (on two different trips) even though they show power ""icons"" for seats at time of reservation. If you do not have long lasting battery backups, try to nap, but the seats are not too soft and comfortable - they are like standard economy airline seats. Then the driver might decide to channel a radio station on the overhead speakers, so there goes your nap. The ""Wifi"" on the bus is slow and spotty at best. The drivers will always try their best to make it on time, but traffic and construction are unpredictable so do not count on being on time at the destination. E.g. just to get out of, or into New York City, (heading to/from Boston) can take 45min-1hr because busses have to take the truck routes - i.e. mid-town tunnel into Queens, and then 295/Throgs Neck to get to/from I95. Traffic is always stopped on these roads till I-95. FlixBus is OK for the price you pay, so take everything else into consideration. Couple of tips - make sure to pay a bit more and reserve a preferred seat if you care, else its open seating. Next, choose non-stop rides as far as possible, since they don't have to detour into local stops to drop/pick passengers.",1,AT,2024-08-08,Trustpilot

Paid extra for the front row of seats and the A/C dripped on me (and my book, luggage, and daughter's laptop (seated next to me).  I contacted customer service and they insisted they couldn't refund my ticket (which of course they can), only give me a voucher for future use, because I had already taken the ride (so, blaming me for getting on the bus that, as it would turn out, would leak all over me).  It made the ride ridiculous - fortunately my husband found a raincoat that I had to cover my entire self with and carefully pour off the water every so often minimizing damage to my stuff. I was told that they would review my situation (I was very insistent) and get back to me after 14 working days.  It is now almost a month and nothing.  I went back to the customer service chat today to follow-up and they have not responded (it has been 20 minutes since I started my first chat).  Also, I had requested a transcript of the chat and they said they don't provide it, but they keep one, so presumedly they intentionally didn't respond.  Sad to say, I feel like their customer service is beyond terrible, so good luck if anything goes wrong.  Avoid.8/1/24:  I have received a response today (only because wi wrote this honest review)  that you resolved this. No you did not. I did not get reimbursed, I did not get a credit, and I did not get contacted as I was told I would be. When I attempted to contact you before I wrote this review no one responded to the chat (I waited 25 minutes. I later saw I was responded to after 28 minutes, but I hadn‚Äôt been able to wait all day to see if I would get a response).

Usually i wouldn‚Äôt mind but i was traveling with a toddler and a 4.5 hour journey is too long to expect them not to use the bathroom. She then decided to stop and informed us she was stopping in this particular place because there was no food so we wouldnt make a mess or leave a mess for her to clean up.

"Cheap, clean, but unprofessional.","Dear FlixBus Customer Service,I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with an experience I had with one of your drivers. Despite having a reservation, my family and I were not allowed to board the bus because the driver insisted that my child, who is over three years old, needed a child seatbelt. According to your policy on the website, ""Children up to 3 years of age must be seated in a suitable child seat that can be secured with a 2-point seat belt. Parents traveling with children must bring their own child car seat with a seat belt adapter."" Since my child is older than three, this requirement should not have applied to us.The driver's behavior was extremely rude, and he refused to let us travel. As a result, we were unable to proceed with our journey, which caused significant inconvenience and distress to my family. I am requesting a refund of $121.95 for the cost of our tickets and a formal apology for the poor treatment we received. I trust that FlixBus values its customers and will address this matter promptly.Thank you for your attention to this issue. I look forward to your response.Sincerely,",2,UA,2024-08-02,Trustpilot

Asked bus driver to stop and wait for him. Bus driver said is not vacation. He kept driving. Asked him to stop so I can get out to join my son. He drove another few min and finally stop . I left bus to find my son at 4 am in strange country. This si some cruel üò¢.  How could you not have compassion to faith few minutes for someone.  We are talking 10 hour ride not ride around city.

Wifi should improve.,"We needed to get from Paris to Brussels and FlixBus was the best option. The bus station Paris Bercy is a bit old and smells bad, with small passages for passengers. Our bus was scheduled at 14.00 and the bus was already at the bay when we arrived an hour in advance but there was no driver. He showed up only a few minutes before departure. He just opened the luggage compartments and let the passengers throw their luggage inside which was a bit chaotic and not that efficient. The drive itself was good with a 15 minutes stop at a resting place along the highway. The bus was comfortable but not cleaned properly and there was a bad urine smell every time the door of the toilet was opened. Some improvement I suggest to FlixBus to make the whole experience better: let the bus driver coordinate the loading of luggage and have a cleaning team in Paris Bercy to clean busses before they start their next trip.

We got to our stop on time with rest stops inbetween and our bags were safe. I will travel with FlixBus again, despite the reviews. Some reviews are bad yes, and this was scary, but can honestly say would travel again no question. Of course we might have been lucky, but we have 2 other journeys booked over the next week - we shall see, fingers crossed we get the same great service. Thank you FlixBus.

The bus was an hour late,"No dia 12 de julho de 2024 apanhei o autocarro da FlixBus de Lisboa para o Porto juntamente com a minha irm√£. Quando entrei no autocarro perguntei ao motorista se podia ir ao WC e este informou de forma arrogante que aquele autocarro n√£o tinha WC esbo√ßando um sorriso sarc√°stico e dizendo de seguida que essa informa√ß√£o estava presente aquando da marca√ß√£o da viagem. Eu n√£o encontrei informa√ß√£o nenhuma sobre isto quando reservei a viagem, e no vosso site tem a informa√ß√£o que os autocarros est√£o equipados com WC. De seguida quando perguntei se iria ent√£o fazer uma paragem a meio, respondeu mais uma vez sarcasticamente que iria parar mas na √∫ltima (e √∫nica) paragem que seria no Porto, n√£o fazendo paragem nenhuma para ida ao WC. Ainda na mesma viagem o homem que se sentava na fila da frente perto de mim perguntou educadamente como poderia comprar uma garrafa de √°gua visto ter tido essa possibilidade noutras viagens. A rea√ß√£o do motorista foi rir e responder ""isto n√£o √© um bar, √© um autocarro, n√£o vendemos √°gua"".Desta forma, gostava ent√£o de perceber como funciona se algu√©m tem problemas de bexiga e precisa de um WC, e esta necessidade b√°sica n√£o √© permitida.

There is no cable charge unit for‚Ä¶,"Well I spoke way too soon.  My original booking was one round trip ticket.  In addition, I needed two one-way tickets on the same outbound bus.  When I went back to book the two additional tickets, my credit card rejected the charge, because I had made back to back transaction online to the same vendor.  They immediately sent me a text asking if I was the one making the charge.  If I was, I just need to remake the charge.  I replied that it was me, then went back to rebook.  FlixBus system told me the charge was rejected again.  Wait a little while and tried again, get the same responce.  Called my credit card company, they said that they had approved the charge, that the charge had gone through and the FlixBus system had returned the payment.  Ok, so I waited a little longer, went back to FlixBus using a different browser, same thing, was told the charge was rejected.  At this point I am pretty frustrated, I already had one ticket on this bus and I needed two more.  Still mistakes happened, so I figured I would call FlixBus customer service and get it straightened out.  Call CS wait and listened to a very long message saying in part that the call would be recorded and they would keep it six months, unless I sent a letter asking that it be deleted sooner.  Finally get a change to make a choice and I push the choice for credit card issue.  I am promptly played a message that everything I need is online and the call hangs up on me.  Call back again, listen to the same long recording, finally get another chance to make a choice, select ""something else"".  I get the same message that everything I need is online and it hangs up.  At this point I spent way too much time on this problem.  I go back online, book the two tickets I need and use a different credit card (one I did not want to use) and get my tickets.  This was not a credit card issue, this is a FlixBus issue.  I have had my credit card for years and never had a problem.  If I want to talk to a person at the credit card company I can always get a person.  FlixBus bus if you not going to let a ""customer"" talk to a ""customer service"" rep, drop the pretense and longwinded messages.  This whole thing was ridiculous. ",4,US,2024-07-30,Trustpilot

It‚Äôs very good to travel with u!,"I travelled from Edmonton, Alberta (Canada) to Calgary, Alberta (Canada) on July 12, 2024.  I needed to bring my assistive walker with me as I have a partial disability.  Tried to put in a request (twice online) to add my assistive walker was a bust.  The website kept telling me that my email addresses didn't match; also that my original booking # was not recognized.  I tried 5 times to call the 1-800 number and could not get through.  Finally was able to connect with someone (internationally - no office in Canada and only an office in Dallas, Texas) and they informed me that I had to pay extra oversized charge on my assistive walker chair.  My fare was $44.00 CAD and the extra charge was $35.00 CAD.  They would not take any further information about having the driver assist me on the bus trip that I booked.  We leave Edmonton from Southgate Terminal (sign was there with the bus name (Green/White) and I found it easily.  We stopped in Red Deer, Alberta for over 10 minutes and were NOT allowed to get off, including just going for a walk.  Arriving in South Calgary (Southcentre Mall) there was vague information about the drop-off point in the 'SE corner of the parking lot at Southcentre Mall'.  The only reason why my friend found me was that a family member takes Flix Bus from a town in Southern Alberta.  If you are disabled, be prepared to not have help or assistance with your needs.  There was also NO complimentary water on the bus which would have been nice, considering that we could not have a snack break while in Red Deer.  If you want to go from point A to point B and want to pay a cheaper bus fare, this bus line is for you.  Hard pass from now on with the problems of contacting customer service with my disability issues; paying extra for my assistive walker as I had to bring my overnight bag with me; no rest stop allowed where passengers could not get off even for a walk break.",5,BR,2024-07-29,Trustpilot

N√£o tinha √°gua no √¥nibus,"So I decided to try something new to get to my mom's. Go would have been cheaper but I was looking at silly transfer times (40 mins, 20 mins, 13 mins and an 18 min walk) so I decided I would spend more to get there quicker and with only a transfer at union with 25 mins to wait. The buses have bathroom and outlet plugs and free wifi and seem more of a coach style. Well, it's a flat fee to get on the bus and then you need to pay for your seat ($2-$5) so I specifically picked window seats. Saturday morning I head into kitchener to grab the bus. Somebody is in my seat. I point out that I reserved that seat specifically and paid extra for it. There's like 6 of us trying to get people out of our seats with no help from the driver. Finally this guy moves his ass and I settle in. I notice there's a cup holder so I open mine up to set my drink in and there's gum, a used bandage and other garbage. I'll hold my coffee thanks. There was gum in all the vents, windows looked like they had been broken and there was safety glass hanging around. The plugs did not work and there was no internet on board. We get going into Toronto and I notice when we left the airport that we were behind schedule and that the gardener was backed up due to an accident so I figured if the driver was smart, we'd leave the gardener and hit the city streets. We do in fact take an off ramp but we turn right instead of left. Seems odd but ok. Then suddenly we're turning in-between two sketchy buildings and the driver is parking the bus. Now keep in mind, the day before some dude was kidnapped in daylight in Vaughan. I'm now in full fledged panic mode. I want to scream, I want to cry, I want to be anywhere but here. Turns out we had to switch drivers... 20 mins from union Station. At this point, I've tried to contact the company through chat 3 times and all I've gotten back is ""thank you for contacting us"" and then silence. Finally we get into union half an hour late which means my connection left 3 mins before. So I head up to the desks to see what can be done to keep me on my way. At this point I didn't realize I was one of 7 that wanted that connection. The lady at the desk made it seem like it was my fault and I should know better and then asking why I paid in American dollars and this and that. She was crusty to everybody. So I get booked onto the next bus and now have 50 mins to waste. I go outside for a smoke and just as I'm putting it in my mouth some homeless guy comes up and goes ""can I both"" and I snapped. I said I'd go find somewhere else to have my fluffing smoke and I walked away. As I'm having my smoke, I'm realizing that it's crazy loud and there's a province full of people in the area. There's some kind of parade going on and now there's a line of 20 buses waiting to get in.I head back in after having a couple smokes and grab myself a cookie and then a seat by a wall plug. They call out that the bus is loading on platform 11 and to start lining up. I head over and get in line and doesn't crusty lady come swaggering over. By this point the board has adjusted and is now showing the next round of buses to load. Remember that parade and line of buses? They're all 15-30 mins behind so now it's showing the Montreal bus and she's trying to tell me I'm in the wrong line. Turns out I wasn't and she had fked up other passengers travels by sending them to other platforms.Then I get to spend 5 mins explaining that the other bus was late and arguing that I know I'm not on a manifest. The driver let's me on and I take a seat at the very back because I realize I'm lucky to get a seat. Remember those other passengers that also needed to transfer? They didn't realize and tried to argue with the driver because there's someone in their seat. My new sheet had a seat that didn't exist, I look over my paperwork so I was able to use my common sense to figure it out. We also had a bus change in Scarborough and more people arguing over seats.",4,US,2024-07-29,Trustpilot

Fuimos desde Florencia hasta Mil√°n con‚Ä¶,"I've taken this route dozens and dozens of times over the years, with Greyhound, Flixbus, and Boltbus before that. Never have I ever had such a horrific experience than this past trip. My bus was meant to leave at 10:20am. I arrived 20 minutes early. After an hour had gone by with no bus in sight, I was concerned. No attempt had been made by Flixbus to inform me of the reason for the lateness, nor was there any tracking status for the bus. After standing in the hot sun for over an hour, I called customer service who could give me absolutely no information. They told me they couldn't get in contact with the driver and to call them back again in 15 if I didn't hear anything. Finally, an hour after scheduled departure, an email was sent that the trip had been delayed until 1:20pm. I was frustrated as I had been waiting in the sun for an hour and no one at Flix bothered to mention the delay/lack of contact with the driver. Myself and another passenger waited until 1pm and then went to wait for our re-scheduled bus. We stood out there in the blaring sun again for another hour with no sign of a bus and no tracking information. I called customer service and was on hold for 30 minutes before an agent even picked up the phone, and it took another 30 minutes of short non-answers and more time wasted being put on hold for them to tell me that our second-delayed bus wasn't coming and suggested I wait for another. I laughed out loud because this suggestion was so absurd and insulting. I had already wasted over 4 hours waiting for two different buses, during which time I was completely ignored by Flixbus and only gained *any* knowledge of the situation by reaching out myself, far after each bus was meant to depart. The customer service agent put me on hold yet again, and finally offered me a voucher for a future trip.

It caused confusion among your waiting customers and heated arguments with the crew. Some suggestions for improvement:- better signage at Marymont to show that Flix operates from that terminus ( even my taxi driver who sent me there was not sure)- that your crew knows the schedule better and can reassure your customers that another bus is picking them upAnd another thing, the bus was supposed to stop at Vilnius main bus station but instead it stopped us several kilometres away.

I left the pick up spot to grab food, always refreshing the link to see any updates. The link kept stating the same 40min delayed pick up time. I arrived 15min prior to the new departure time only to never have the bus arrive. I called customer service and was told that all the passengers boarded 27min prior to the new departure time. I asked why the link did not reflect the new pick up time and I was told that it's not the company's fault, that it's my fault for not being there. They did not take any responsibility for not updating the link. And they lied to me as I spoke with 3 other passengers who also did not board the bus due to the wrong info on the email and link. I had to purchase another ticket for the next bus. It's amazing how the company sends out wrong info and then turns around and blames the passengers for their mistake.

Venlig og kompetent chauff√∏r,"       I took FlixBus from Chicago to Bloomington, Indiana and it was a great choice! The facilities and staff were excellent, the trip was quick and easy. When I factored in the time it would have taken to get to O'Hare Airport from my location in Chicago, along with the wait time at the airport, and the time it would have taken to drive from the Indianapolis Airport, along with the price of gas, it saved both time and money.        Coincidentally, I had cancelled my flight from O'Hare and booked my FlixBus ride about a week before my return trip to Bloomington. It turned out that the international internet outage that began around Thursday, July 18 caused many flight cancellations at O'Hare on the day I was scheduled to fly home to Bloomington. Thanks to FlixBus, my trip home was quick and easy. I don't know how long I would have had to wait for a flight.        I'll definitely be using FlixBus again!",5,US,2024-07-28,Trustpilot

Now it was my second time Travel with‚Ä¶,"I have previously enjoyed using Flix bus service.  However, my most recent trip from Hamilton to London, Ontario today was made extremely upsetting as I had discovered in advance that the address for the new passenger pickup location in Hamilton Flix had implemented  at King Street West and Dundurn was WRONG.   I had called the business at the wrongly given address on the Flix booking site two days prior to my trip, wanting to confirm the address location.  The gas station manager said it was WRONG, NO FLIX BUS WAS STOPPING AT HIS LOCATION.  He was getting many calls from similarly cautious passengers.  I wasted an hour and a half of my time, calling the Flix customer service number (totally useless employee who did not have a clue about the location in Hamilton, Ontario, and kept parroting the wrong address.  Three attempts to contact more capable staff on the chat option also ended with getting no help at all.  I am now apprised of a fatal flaw in Flix bus operations.  If anything goes wrong, it will not be corrected.  I ended up going to the general vicinity, walking up and down the hideously noisy street looking for a Flix bus stop sign, to no avail. This is a major intersection with four corners and multiple large business and parking lots. Other hapless passengers anxiously joined me and confirmed the same miserable, fruitless experience dealing with this issue of a WRONG ADDRESS and the total lack of help or corrective action taken by Flix.  A driver did appear a little way up the road and confirmed when we were boarding that the wrong address was being given by the Flix company booking site.  He was an excellent driver, but when I disembarked at my destination and asked him to contact his dispatcher about this problem, he said the dispatcher could do nothing about it.  I WANT ACTION TAKEN BY FLIX to correct this situation, which causes great anxiety for passengers and great frustration when they attempt to contact Flix to fix the issue.",5,GB,2024-07-27,Trustpilot

Satisfied ,"We are two female passengers on the Flixbus journey dated June 17, 2024, on Route N729, traveling from Paris (Bercy Seine) at 00:30 to Lyon Perrache (1h20 transfer) at 06:00, and then transferring to Route 122 to continue our journey to Geneva, arriving at 09:45 as per the ticket information.However, upon transferring at the Flixbus station in Lyon Perrache, we discovered that our luggage had been stolen. Specifically, we placed 4 suitcases in the bus compartment as per the driver's request. He demanded an additional 20‚Ç¨ in cash for the luggage and did not provide any receipt for the payment.At the time of the incident, we immediately informed the driver and the assistant that three of our suitcases were missing from the cabin compartment, but were met with indifference and a careless response: ""They were probably stolen during the recent stop."" When we requested the driver to assist by writing a confirmation of the lost luggage, he refused and irritably replied: ""Fill out the online form and you will be compensated by Flixbus.""We have filled out the online form with all necessary trip details, bus number, and the section where the luggage was lost, and have submitted it. However, despite calling Flixbus multiple times, we received only automated responses instructing us to fill out the online form, with no further assistance provided by the company.This loss has left us extremely exhausted and distressed. In the suitcase there are many important item and documents of mine, including documents in my country. After regaining our composure, we urgently write this letter to express our concerns and demand a proper response and fair compensation for our loss.We hoped that Flixbus company will genuinely support us in recovering our lost suitcases or provide reasonable compensation.I filled the lost of luggages's form on Flixbus website immediately after their request. Not only once but also four times. But THEY ARE NOT! JUST GIVE ME AN IRRESPONSIBLE ANSWER THAT ""THEY WILL NOT COMPENSATE"". Meanwhile, Flixbus's luggage policy are clearly stated as in the image I attached below.

I‚Äôm not upset about the bus breaking down - these things happen - but I found the lack of support shocking. We were left at a Park and Ride, with the driver telling us we could just catch the next bus two hours later. When I looked up this bus, it said that it was almost full. We were all anxious, as many of us had ferries or flights to catch in Aberdeen, and could not wait another two hours. Fortunately, a driver from another bus company helped us find cheap seats with another bus company that would get us there faster.

We were unable to get updates on app or by phone as we waited for bus to arrive.  It was a horrible experience.

Less than half an hour before departure, I received a notification that the bus would be delayed by 45 minutes. However, when I arrived at 16:50, the bus had already left, having only been delayed by 3 minutes.I contacted customer service, and they were incredibly unhelpful. They claimed it was a system error and offered only to refund the ticket price, deducting a handling fee. Later, they stated that a refund was not possible, despite already having refunded the ticket price, showing their incompetence and lack of coordination.Due to their misleading notification, I incurred significant additional costs.FlixBus may be cheap, but you can't rely on any support if something goes wrong. I strongly advise everyone to travel with a more reliable provider. This experience has been extremely stressful and costly, and the lack of proper customer service only made it worse.Edit: After more emails it convinced me that FlixBus has the most incompetent customer service that I have ever seen.

Everyting was perfect!!,"Firstly, I am only evaluating my return journey since the outbound trip was never offered by the company. I purchased two tickets from St. Catharines (BROCK UNIVERSITY) to Toronto for Friday, 12/07, at 13:55. However, the bus never stopped at the designated stop listed on the Flixbus website. My wife, another traveler, and I were left waiting and missed our commitments on the 12th in Toronto. The Flixbus chat representative confirmed that the driver did not stop at our Brock University stop, a route that was inaugurated on July 4th. Even though this did not resolve our issue, we requested a refund for the segment, which the representative stated was not possible because the ticket had already been issued. This is absurd. Flixbus sells a service that was never provided, and when we claimed our right to a refund, we were told it was not possible. Another customer in the same situation managed to speak with a representative over the phone and was advised to call an Uber, with costs covered by Flixbus. Our representative did not offer us this option. Fortunately, we are sociable people and interacted with the other customer, who offered us a ride in their Uber to Toronto. This was the only reason we managed to reach our destination, which is why I am now evaluating our return journey on 14/07 at 4 pm. Despite the negligence on Friday, when we returned on Sunday, our bus once again did not stop at Brock University, as stated on the ticket sold on the site. Another passenger on this return trip was in the same situation as us. We informed the driver, who apologized but stated that he had no information about this new line to Brock University. Thus, despite the complaints made on Friday, by the end of Sunday, the buses and drivers on this route were still not updated and not fulfilling the advertised service. This is a classic case of false advertising and undue advantage, refusing to acknowledge the error in the sale and not offering at least a refund to the affected customers. Not to mention all the other damages caused by the lack of service, preventing us from reaching our destination on time (or close to it). Finally, I have filed a complaint through the company's website and expect at least a refund for my tickets, both outbound and return, as the service sold was never provided. I also inform that appropriate measures will be taken against the company to seek compensation for the other damages caused. My experience with Flixbus? False advertising, undue advantage over customers, terrible after-sales service, and poor internal organization of the company",5,GB,2024-07-22,Trustpilot

Moreover, there was no place to sit at the parking lot of the main train station in Prague while waiting for the bus. I believe it's not primarily the fault of FlixBus but when such a large company provides regular departures from this location, I believe ensuring customer comfort (especially when the buses are so often late) should be a priority.

Very easy to use website for bookings.,"HORRIBLE experience that messed up the whole holiday.Short story: defective website caused us and many others to find ourselves with no fare, and on such short notice, no alternative to go where we had to, all while FlixBus representative turned our back to us, then claimed to help us and left when we needed him.We ended up spending >‚Ç¨200 for 1 night stay at a hotel so we could work out an alternative, lost ~‚Ç¨100 for one missed day at the hotel we were supposed to get to, and had to spend another ~‚Ç¨350 for urgent transport, and lost the ‚Ç¨170 spent on FlixBus.---Long story:I wanted to buy tickets for late 14 July, and the only fitting time I could find was AFTER Midnight: there was a warning saying ""Careful, this will be the next day"" or something similar.I carried on buying the tickets, and on the day we needed to use the bus N428 from Bologna, everything seemed strange from the start:The whole central bus station was empty of buses, there was NO signage showing where FlixBus will be, what the timetables are, or anything like that.We noticed that many green buses at times come at the start of the station, so we waited there and found someone representing FlixBus, whom upon being asked for help, only said ""wait for the bus with your number"" and left, so I had to look for him again to find him & ask WHERE are we supposed to wait? ""Stations from 2 to 8"", so we did.At the time the bus arrived, 00:15, it was slightly later than it was scheduled to arrive, but we were happy we could finally get on, at which point we were told there was a problem with the code on our tickets, and that our tickets were actually for the 14TH OF JULY 00:05.THE DRIVER told us THIS HAPPENS VERY OFTEN!I asked him what we could do, and he sent us to the representative we approached before, who will help us get on N245 and apply for our money back.The Rep was sorting out another problem where 4 people's driver drove off without them after he told them he'd wait to embark, as they needed to finish talking with the representative. We waited for a long time, and when we asked for his help, he said ""it's your fault for not double checking"", and that he's ""not accusing of anything, only telling what the CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL TELL US"".I explained the whole situation in the same amount of detail as here, and as I was talking, he just turned and left, speaking with other people and ignoring me.At that point I was just shocked, how could this just happen? Complaining on my way back, someone heard me and told me they had huge problems with FlixBus too, travelling from Germany, and having 4~6 hour mismatches in his buses' travel, even thought when he bought it, the journey was Direct.He helped us looking at some alternatives, but all trains seemed to be booked until the following day, no other buses came to Foggia, and the only other option would be to possibly rent a car, but which would cause logistic problems down the road.After a long time in which we tried to look at different options, my father walked back to the Rep, who came looking bothered, but trying to show that he is helpful.He took my phone, looked for an alternative route using the FlixBus app. I filled in all the details, all-the-while the Rep seemed anxious for some reason, and after we eventually reached the payment page, he left to help others.I filled-in the payment page, but the payment was denied. I thought it was strange, but it can happen, so I used another's card; this was also denied.I thought ""Ok, maybe there's a problem with the card processing software, thankfully I have PayPal Credit, and that can cover it"".This one was also denied with an API error.After the 3rd attempt, I thought I'd ask the Rep about it, but he was nowhere to be seen. I asked some people in high-vision vests, looking like they may be working there, and they said that nobody from FlixBus was left, everybody was now gone.At that point we were panicking, but around 1:30, we decided we were too tired to do anything, and the only option left for us was to sleep somewhere and look for a solution in the daytime.I will _NEVER_ recommend this company to anybody.",5,US,2024-07-21,Trustpilot

(3) All six rides reached destination on or before time. (4) On 3 rides (Delhi to Dharamshala on 7th June '24) drinking water bottles were provided to all passengers - nice gesture at very low cost, but very useful and highly appreciated given the extremely hot weather.(5) In the Delhi - Dharamshala ride on 7th June '24, light fleece wraps were available for all passengers.CAN IMPROVE - (1) 3 of the six rides started 30 min. late (Delhi to Dharamshala on 7th June '24) - if proper information had been provided, we could have stepped out from FlixBus Lounge at Kashmere Gate, Delhi and had a bite or tea/coffee.(2) On the Dharamshala to Delhi journey (15th June '24), very few fleece wraps were available - some passengers like my wife could get and use, others like me had to do without any cover.(3) On the Dharamshala o Delhi ride on 15th June '24 NO drinking water bottles were provided, although we had seen some bottles being loaded and kept in the luggage hold of the bus. Passengers requesting water bottles were told by the staff of the bus that the Company does not provide for water bottles for passengers, and they are not bound to distribute the bottles they had loaded in the bus.

Dejlig bus,"We had a round-trip booked from Spokane Washington to Seattle Washington June 22, 2024 to June 27, 2024. We arrived at the bus station 30 minutes early. When no one else was there, we went inside to inquire and were told that the departure location for flix bus was now on the other side of the station. We went to the other side and we're told by a passenger that the bus we were booked on for 7:55 AM had departed at 7 AM. I looked again at my electronic ticket as well as logging into the app, and both still said 7:55, but it was already that time. We went to the ticket office and the guy said, ""ya, the bus left at 7"". After a bit of questioning, he said to call customer service. He didn't have the number to give us. He finally told us it was on the door or website. When we called customer service, they didn't explain much other than to say that the 7:55 bus had problems with the insurance because of the location that the bus was scheduled to drop off at (what the heck??!!). They finally rebooked us for the 11:15 bus. In total, we waited in a bot bus station for over 3 hours. If they would have notified us in advance, we could have been home, out of the heat for those hours. On the return trip, we arrived at the Seattle Bus Station 30 minutes before departure. The tickets still said the bus would leave at 11:00. At 11:15 someone at the station came out to the boarding area to say, ""Oh, you guys are going to hate me!! I don't even want to tell you!"" I said, ""hurry and tell us before our ride gets on the freeway and we're stuck here!"". She didn't. She hemmed and hated and joked until 15 minutes later when she finally said, ""it looks like it might not leave until about 1:30 because the bus is broke down"". By then our ride had gotten on the freeway and was almost back in Edmonds. My electronic ticket still said it was leaving at 11:00. Geez. So two times we were stuck in hot bus stations in industrial areas (no where to get a bite to eat, no way to get to where it was cool) for several hours, unecessarily. The return trip didn't end up leaving until 3 pm. It was hours late with no notice. The ticket didn't change until right before we left. Ridiculous. We both have health problems that are severely impacted by being in the heat on hard seats. When we called later to complain, their answers were ""We got you to your destination. There is no compensation."" The first person I spoke to actually hung up on me!! When I called back I was told the same thing. I asked for their supervisor and she said that she was the highest person taking calls, that her manager doesn't take escalation calls. I asked when a manager would be there that would take a call and she said she has no idea. ",4,TR,2024-07-17,Trustpilot
Well everything was okay,"We arrived early for the bus as instructed, but the bus did not arrive until an hour after scheduled departure. There was no seating and no facilities of any kind in the waiting area.  (I am 68 years old and have arthritis; standing for over an hour caused pain which will require treatment.)  The bus that did arrive was not marked as Flix; it seemed to be an emergency stand-in and did not belong to any particular company.  No announcements were made during the delayed departure nor at the time of the arrival of the bus at the depot regarding the length of the delay, reasons, apologies, etc.        The bus driver, when the bus did arrive, was brusque and shouted commands at passengers as if we were new draftees arrived for military service and behaved as if we were responsible for the delay.  He seemed to have forgotten the words ""sir,"" ma'am"" and ""please."" Care was not taken in stowing baggage items: our request to keep our (two) bags together was not honored, heavier items were thrown on lighter ones.  A compartment of my bag opened en route in the baggage stowage.        The driver did not introduce himself, welcome passengers, or make any announcements as the bus departed.  No rules were announced or enforced regarding playing loud music by some customers.      The air conditioning on the bus was inadequate, and the bus was extremely hot.  The driver was aware of this, and eventually instructed us (passengers) to open the emergency exit on the ceiling to ""get some air into the hot bus"" (his words). This helped somewhat, but of course the outside air was hot as well.       Overall, the experience was stressful.

Faccio presente che avevo anche il posto assegnato sedile 6.‚Ä®Scopro anche la mia fermata a Martinsicuro √® stata soppressa da circa un mese, ma non ho avuto nessuna comunicazione! Alla fine, dopo un estenuante discussione davanti ad altri clienti attoniti, per non rimanere a piedi, sono costretto a fare un ulteriore biglietto, che mi costa molto di pi√π del precedente. Una volta in viaggio le sorprese non finiscono, sorprese negative ovviamente, mi metto in contatto con il servizio clienti tramite app, l‚Äôagente mi propone un voucher per un viaggio futuro, ovviamente rifiuto perch√© non ho pi√π fiducia in questa azienda, alla fine mi propone un rimborso parziale di 65 corone danesi (circa 8‚Ç¨)!

Sono veramente disgustato, sia per il disguido sul biglietto sia per la compensazione che mi √® stata offerta, con la scusa della politica aziendale, pensano che tutto sia giustificabile! Se questa √® la vostra politica aziendale e il modo di gestire i viaggi con i vostri clienti √® meglio che cambiate mestiere, sicuramente avete perso un cliente che non potr√† certo farvi una pubblicit√† positiva, fatevi un esame di coscienza e cercare di capire chi ha sbagliato e cercate di essere pi√π seri nei miei confronti e nei confronti dei clienti!

Pur essendo ancora infastidito per quanto accaduto il 4 luglio scorso, sono almeno parzialmente soddisfatto del rimborso, il minimo che mi sarei aspettato per il loro disguido. Rimane comunque la mia esperienza negativa e la perdita di tempo. Comunque almeno il rimborso e le scuse dovute, sono da me ben accette. ",5,SE,2024-07-16,Trustpilot

Flix Bus deliberately confused this post with an alternative problem3.Flix Bus cannot provide Evidence to back up their Lie in this regard.--‚Äê----------------------------------------Original Complaint Dear FlixBus Customer Service. On this review platform you have never answered customers  negative experiences. I note however, you respond to praise.I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the handling of my recent complaint regarding the journey, booking number 3171963466, from Lviv, Ukraine to Radom City, Poland on 25th June 2024.Not only did Flix Bus put me onto another coach at a different time however squashed me into a bus with no working toilet or with emergency clean drinking water facilities (the weather was 24.c at night and 30.c during our wait at the Krakovets Border.According to EU Regulation 181/2011, passengers do have the right to be informed about delays and to receive assistance during significant delays during the trip. The Trip Journey that I had undertaken with you was scheduled for eta 12 hours However, during the 12+ hour delay stopped at the Krakovets border, I did not receive any information from you about the delay or the estimated arrival time. The eventual trip time was 24 hours.Furthermore, no assistance was provided, such as snack, meals, refreshments, despite the delay exceeding 90 minutes for a journey longer than 3 hours.As FlixBus failed to meet these obligations, I am requesting adequate compensation for the inconvenience caused. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to a satisfactory resolution.Yours sincerely Alec Nayler",5,CA,2024-07-16,Trustpilot

Easy to book,"First time I had trouble booking ticket online. Bus arrives and the driver helped me book the ticket on my phone. the date was wrong, so he wouldn't let me board. HE booked the ticket for me. Unbelievable.  No phone number on ticket or website, after extensive googling for number I called, waited on hold for 45 minutes, then told no refund because bus had already left. Stranded and had to spend 250$ on a hotel room and get next days bus. Horrible customer service. Currently waiting for a bus at the address on ticket, but zero signage or indication this is a bus stop. Extensive googling to find phone number again only to speak to somebody with limited English skills. I was told to ""wait by wooden bench"". I'm not optimistic and hate that they do everything in their power to avoid talking to customers. Miserable company. Update: received canned response from Flixbus with terrible grammer and no remorse, just to further prove how out of touch they are and how they DO NOT CARE at all. Avoid these people.

Safe and smooth trip and convenient.Safe and smooth trip and convenient.,"1. Bus driver asked not to seat in the first seats. I paid extra for those especific seats. Seans other seats were reserved, I asked him nicely what should we do and he said ‚Äúseat somewhere else, what do you want me to do‚Äù2. After 1 hour, the bus was getting too hot and breathing was hard. Someone else asked to please lower the AC and the vents. He said he did.3. 1:30 hrs later we were still complaining and he said he was going to stop somewhere to try to take a look. I told him we cannot keep riding like that, he really need to stop. I told him there was a rest stop 5 minutes away for him to take a look. He responded very rudely saying that he didn‚Äôt need my help and don‚Äôt tell himWhat to do. 4. He swings by the rest stop I told him about (Southbound, Mile Post, New Jersey Turnpike, 30 2 South, Cherry Hill, NJ 08034) and asked me if I wanted to take off the bus. I asked if he was going to refunded me, he said no. 5. I called flixbus to file a complaint, they said they were going to called the dispatched team so they can call the bus driver and probably provide a mechanic, that that was going to cause a delay, i said it doesn‚Äôt matter, but provide a solution, this situation was beyond being comfortable it was harmful. After probably 2 and more hrs and after asked him if he can open the windows in the ceiling of the bus he stopped in the middle of a rest stop turn the car off and on and continue. He didn‚Äôt open the windows. 6. We asked him about an update, he said he was going to wait around 10 miles or so to see if that resets the system. People started to complain more and put pressure he decided to stop again and finally open the windows. 7. By this time I already broken into tears because of an anxiety attack. I had called Flixbus 2 times by then, called them again two time more and didn‚Äôt pick up my calls. By this time we also received an email from Flixbus saying that the bus didn‚Äôt have AC and that we were able to cancel or reschedule our trip. When we were already the road. 8. We were supposed to arrive to DUPON CIRCLE per our ticket, and without any announcement he pulled in to UNION STATION. WHen I asked him if he was going to do another stop in Dupon circle, he says that that was the best he can do, that I wasn‚Äôt speaking english, and that I needed to take the subway or the metro. He tried to switch buses at Delaware but flixbus was not providing any help and he suggested to file a complaint with the company. I felt unsafe, mistreated, disrespected, overall it was the worst experience with a service in The US in my 7 years living here. I am requesting the full refund of my tickets as the minimum compensation we deserve for everything me and my partner through.  ",4,US,2024-07-16,Trustpilot

Great way of getting around Italy,"Flixbus engaged in very unethical behavior, so please beware. When you purchase a ticket, you can choose to also purchase the seat next to you to provide more room since these buses cram you into a seating space worse than the airlines do. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù, so I always purchase two seats. I purchased seats 2C and 2D and received my digital ticket a week ago. Then the day before my journey, yesterday, they send me an email re-issuing me my reservation with a new booking number. The old ticket and booking number no longer worked. And in this new booking, I only had 2D reserved. Seat 2C was nowhere to be found. When I boarded the bus, my suspicions were confirmed: they sold 2C to a new customer. So Flixbus sold the same seat twice and never provided me with any kind of explanation or refund. That is the definition of theft: taking money or property without permission and without providing any compensation. ",5,HR,2024-07-16,Trustpilot

Autob√∫s de Bilbao a Oporto nocturno perdido por falta de indicaciones de And√©n‚Ä¶,"The bus broke down on the highway (autobahn) and he didn‚Äôt know what to do, he was driving backwards!!! And was going to drive 100 km with 20km/hr in the middle of the night. Then he stopped at the middle of nowhere in Bulgaria not far from Shumen, the place was a tiny store, no bathrooms available. No information available , especially not in English. There were multiple nationals on the bus and communication was difficult. This was at 11.30pm! Thankfully a taxi stopped and I grabbed it, it took us to Bukarest. The FlixBus driver was rude, dismissive , smoked on the bus while driving and shared no info on why the bus couldn‚Äôt go more than 20km/hr. He put our life at risk, by driving slowly on the emergency lane for a some time and also going backwards on the highway ! I took videos of his recklessness . I was about to call 112, and my embassy for help. I started chatting with the customer service chat on your website. I never received any answer! This is insane. I was a passenger along with my 10 year old daughter who got traumatized by yesterday‚Äôs happenings. I checked on the route of 1940 on yr website which states the bus was in Razgrad at 12.03am which is a lie bc the bus was on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere at that time. Outrageous service. Not even mentioned that I reserved our seats in advance and paid extra. Couple days before our travel I was sent a different departure time and not my seats I purchased so I purchased them again. Then the bus arrived and it was a small bus , not what was on the website and my seats I reserved did not even exist! And I payed for them 2x!!! This was a terrifying experience.

Autista con guida impeccabile,"I am very much disappointed with FlixBus services during my last trip from Munich to Sofia on the 5th of July, 2024.One of the two drivers was very cruel and ill mannered. He was shouting at some of the passengers, including me.I cannot name this driver, becase none of them has introduced oneself to the passengers.The WiFi was not properly working.The WC was in a bad condition from the beginning of the travel, no toilet paper and soap were available, only trickle water spurt to wash one's hands. There was not at all water in the reservoir to clean the lavatory after its usage. This has led to locking the WC in a few hours after the trips' beginning and the bus was full with passengers.The whole trip was spoilt by the drivers' bad behaviour towards passengers. They were not enough supportive with the luggage loading and uploading, because of the bad organization of these activities.At the stops they didn't keep the announced by them time of breaks and didn't imform the passengers where to find the toilets at some of the bus stations.Please try to train the Bulgarian drivers how to deal with passengers who pay for the transport services of FlixBus and how to make such a long-lasting trip more pleasant.Kind regards,Silviya HinkovaTel.: +359 878908435",5,GB,2024-07-16,Trustpilot

Amazing and great and courteous and‚Ä¶,This review pertains to the Florence-Genoa trip. We boarded in Florence and stowed our bags in the hold.  Arrived in Genoa and descended to get our bags for our connection to Nice and the bags were gone.  The driver suggested someone on the street walking by likely stole them after they opened the luggage hold.  The stop is on a street in an industrial part of town and not an official bus station like in Florence which is a gorgeous station by contrast.  I wish they had warned us or the driver had watched the bags being unloaded.  We quickly filed a police report before getting our connection. I filed a claim online with FlixBus and no one has responded yet.  Customer service has been non-existent.  No response yet several days later.  I may modify this review if I actually get a response and some compensation for the loss. They should not stop at a dangerous stop like the one in Genoa and leave the bags unattended when they open the luggage hold.  We walked around the area to see if it was dumped and saw other bags behind cars and near trash cans.  This is not a safe area for a stop and they should have issued a warning as I imagine this is not the first time this has happened. ,5,DE,2024-07-15,Trustpilot

I used flixbus in the US multiple 4‚Ä¶,"I took a bus from Zagreb to Vienna. I‚Äôve taken that route many times and I knew some shi* was going to go down because it does literally every time. This time we waited at the Slovenian border 1.5h because one passenger didn‚Äôt have his visa. The rest of us were waiting in front of the bus, smoking, talking. Just before the driver returned with the papers he was waiting for by the police station, one passenger informed us all (including the other driver) that he has to go to the toilet, and left. As soon as the first driver returned, we all got in the bus and slowly started driving. A passenger noticed that that one guy was missing and we all started telling the drivers someone was missing. It took them some persuading to stop, I don‚Äôt know if they didn‚Äôt understand us or they didn‚Äôt want to waste any more time. Their final destination was somewhere in Slowakia. Then we made our routine stop in Maribor, the app said 5 minute break. I ran to the kiosk, bought a sandwich and rushed back to the bus only to find myself puzzled because the bus wasn‚Äôt there. Some other bus driver told me that a FlixBus just left and that I still might have the chance to catch them at the streetlight from the other side of the bus station. I ran to no avail. All my luggage, including my cash wallet, ipad, library books, my dead mother‚Äôs clothes and other items that I inherited from her, it all was on it‚Äôs way to Vienna without anyone to watch over it. I called Flixbus, and as expected, they said - buy another bus ticket and fill out a lost luggage form. No refund, it is your fault that it took you longer than the break lasted (which it didn‚Äôt!!)I started panicking and crying, so I called my friend in Vienna if she can pick up my stuff from the bus once it arrives to Erdberg. Meanwhile I found another form of transportation sparingly using my phone because I had 15% of battery left, 2 more hours of driving, and a friend that needed my instructions. After an hour everything seemed to be resolved - my friend picked up my belongings from my designated seat and managed to dig out my suitcase from the storage. She told me all the passengers were very angry at the drivers because they‚Äôve apparently been telling them that a person is missing, but the drivers refused to stop the bus.  You can imagine my sadness when I realised that the suitcase she took was not mine. It was the same brand, same color and size, with just a few different details that, I admit, I haven‚Äôt thought of because I was panickig and didn‚Äôt really think that the scenario of someone having the same suitcase was even possible. I‚Äôve managed to get in contact with the passenger whose luggage I have and arrange a return because Flixbus is not responding to my, whether to his inquiries about lost and found luggage. I‚Äôm scared that Flixbus is never going to return me my luggage. I‚Äôm being kept in the dark - I‚Äôm not getting any information whatsoever from them. Every time I call they tell me to fill out the form again. I was also told that the responsibility to watch over the bus is mine and that a refund is not possible. I have no way to prove the drivers‚Äô incompetence. Why didn‚Äôt they count their passengers BOTH TIMES before leaving? Why did they make a shorter break than it said on the app? Why haven‚Äôt I received a tag for the suitcase? I hate the fact that FlixBus is the only bus company that connects Zagreb and Vienna. I have an upcoming trip again tomorrow. Who knows what else is going to happen? I am traumatized from that hue of green and the music of the waiting lobby of their telephone customer support. ",1,GB,2024-07-13,Trustpilot

Great Flixbus,My experience with flixbus was the worse experience anyone could have went through. The driver was aggressive as well as tired. She made an unscheduled stop 45 minutes before the scheduled stop in Effingham and brought five hour energy drinks to keep woke. Once in Effingham she ordered food as well as brought more five hour energy drinks. She always made a statement saying that she needs to find a way to stay up.Once on the road again we started to notice she was swerving more than she was before we stopped in Effingham. We heard a boom like something was hit & then felt a big swerve right like she was dodging something before she swerved hard left and drove onto a construction zone hitting barrels at a high speed for over a mile & a half. At this point the entire bus is in an uproar and terrified. We screamed for her to stop but she continued to scream back that she knows what she is doing and everything is okay. We tell her she doesn‚Äôt know what to expect ahead of her it‚Äôs dark and she‚Äôs goin really fast. She comes to a stop abruptly noticing if she had not the work truck loaded with a propane would have been struck by her causing fatal injuries to all. As she exited the construction area with the help of the workers & police she proceeded to speak over the intercom saying ‚Äú while yall gossiping I didn‚Äôt fall asleep I misread the road‚Äù. And the entire bus is just in awe because we was under the impression the mic didn‚Äôt work because she was screaming at us in Chicago about the rules while on the bus. Once we exited the interstate we was met by state troopers who informed us that we would be waiting for another driver and that she was not licensed to drive. Another driver did not arrive until after 1 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon meaning we sat outside a Mach gas station since 5 o‚Äôclock in the morning. Once we received our new driver another incident occurred where a passenger wanted to exit the bus somewhere not listed as a stop. Other passengers tried to inform him that we wasn‚Äôt far from our destination and he should wait. He got mad and yelled out his going to the dark side and began shouting gang racial slurs to the passengers around him. He threatened one passenger and when she replied back he spat on her causing a ruckus forcing the driver to pull over at the nearest exit with a public place to let him off the bus. We all filed out incident report for the driver stating he was a problem & wanted to exit. ,5,CA,2024-07-12,Trustpilot

No complaints,When I took a Flix bus from Berlin to Prague our bus broke down just before the German-Czech border while we were on the motorway. The bus pulled into a car park and we were stuck for over four hours. Our drivers were absolutely useless and did practically nothing to solve the situation after the repair man was unable to fix the engine. The only solution they had was to wait and hope that other buses came along to pick up a few passengers at a time with whatever space they had. It got to the point where the driver said he didn‚Äôt even know if another bus was coming and we may be stranded overnight. We had no food or water and naturally were freaking out. Eventually me and my friend resorted to hitchhiking to Prague and made it to our destination in a strangers car. The next day I contacted Flix bus and requested a refund however was told that we were ineligible because we could only receive compensation if we took another form of public transport to complete our journey. How were we supposed to find other means of transport if we were stranded at the side of the motorway? We received no compensation what so ever. Absolute joke of a company. Avoid traveling with Flix bus if you can.,5,CA,2024-07-11,Trustpilot

Volvo bus,"We took a bus back while moving so that we could leave one car with a family member near the new house. We didn't have solid enough plans to get train tickets in time, so we decided to take the bus back. Our trip was about 10 hours including stops.Our bus wasn't full for most of the trip up through California to Oregon, but filled up as we neared Portland. Since there were a lot of empty seats, people were free to sit where they wished. Basically, if you're in someone's seat they can dispute if they wish, but I only saw one person do this.The air conditioner on the bus worked very well and the seats were comfortable. Decent legroom but it depends if you bring a large bag with you. Our drivers weren't strict with bag sizes but this is likely something that depends on how full the bus is.Two issues with the bus: the toilet didn't flush, and the outlets didn't work. I didn't need to charge anything but I would recommend bringing a portable charger for this situation, especially if the drive is long. In addition to the stops for pickup and drop-off, our bus made two or three stops at gas stations and rest stops for people to buy snacks and use the restroom. Basically, if you need to pee more frequently than every few hours, this is a bit of a risk (the flusher didn't work so you could technically use the toilet, but it filled up as the drive went on...) This is the only time I've taken this kind of long-haul bus, so I have no idea how common these issues are.Overall, I was quite satisfied. It was physically comfortable, and we got home on time. It's really about the same as being a passenger in a car but you have to get to the stop on time and there is the possibility of a bathroom onboard. At longer distances it takes longer but is much cheaper, more comfortable, and less invasive than going by plane. Like most modes of travel, it's more fun with a friend.",5,NL,2024-07-10,Trustpilot

Cambiamos de autob√∫s en G√©nova y ese tampoco fue doble piso. Afortunadamente, en este viaje  el wifi si funcion√≥. Desafortunadamente, en este viaje el ba√±o era una tristeza.

You can select which seat you have, or choose to have an empty seat next to you, but these options can almost double the price. - I imagine a tall person would struggle with leg room in most seats, and keeping a rucksack stashed down by your feet for easy access isn't practical.In summary, it was far better than I expected, and I would use Flixbus again.",5,CA,2024-07-10,Trustpilot

Not too bad! üòä,"FlixBus was FIVE hours late past its departure time due to maintenance issues. The bus was scheduled to leave at 8:30am and at 11am they told us a backup bus would arrive around 1:30pm. Another bus that was scheduled to leave at 6:30am was not announced to be cancelled until 10:30am. FlixBus must absoulutely work on announcing delays and cancellations far FAR earlier. They should also reschedule AND refund those whose buses were cancelled or delayed so much that travel became impossible.Furthermore, when I tried to cancel my ticket and receive a refund, they tried to charge me a substantial cancellation fee. I was able to circumvent this by speaking directly to a representative. But the cancellation fee should never have been an option for a trip that was so totally ruined by the missteps of FlixBus itself.At 11am, also, a representative tried to claim that the bus had in fact departed on time (shortly after the on-site staff announced that the replacement would arrive at 1:30). FlixBus needs to update their system to reflect where buses are so customers can plan accordingly and request refunds when needed.Refunds should be given in cash or chargebacks, NOT just vouchers.Refunds should be given to customers who wish to cancel after 30 minutes or perhaps 60 minutes. 120 minutes is a very long time to wait to receive a full refund when a bus that is 2 hours late can completely ruin a trip.My trip was made completely impossible due to FlixBus's negligence in maintaining their vehicles and backup buses, and their poor communication. This is also not the first time I have traveled with FlixBus when the bus has broken down or been many hours late. The quality of service was much better several years ago. What happened?I would refrain from recommending FlixBus, but what choice do we have? There are very few competing bus companies in many parts of the country and Amtrak is a joke.

Easy and fast,"Bus didn‚Äôt show up. No communication from the company. Had to chat and call with multiple customer service representatives only to be told call back 15 minutes later as they had no information on the status of the bus. Many passengers were confused on what to do. One of the passengers got through to a customer service representative who sent a message saying the bus is canceled. So, many passengers made alternative plans like taking the train. When we called the customer service later for a refund, they refused. Because apparently the bus showed up 45-50 minutes late and the policy states that the bus can be late for up to 2 hours. Unbelievable.On top of this, the bus stop/terminal was closed. So people had to wait outside in the cold. No access to facilities like restrooms or seating while waiting for a bus for which there was no status update. Nobody to talk to. This was a 6 am bus for which I woke up at 4 am to get ready and catch a Uber! The stop also doesn‚Äôt feel safe as it is in a sketchy area with lot of homeless people lying around with smell of pee all around.

Super easy,"I bought a ticket to return home from NYC and was scheduled to depart out of their midtown Manhattan bus station. This stop is a mess and a sad excuse for a ""station"" as there is no built infrastructure. As I was there in 90 degree weather, it was dangerous to be waiting for my bus and I was concerned for other riders who were older than me. The bus station is just a parking lot with buses entering and exiting at all times and people dangerously weaving inbetween. There is no signage or communication around where each bus is traveling to so it's a mad dash to find your bus and get on in time. The buses are fairly dirty with trash littering the seats and aisle. The staff are stressed- running around and trying to manage buses, people, and taxis and cars that try to enter the lot to park. Along with a handful of riders, I was incorrectly told that my bus had not yet arrived even though I got to the bus stop the recommended 20 minutes before departure. I was told to wait by a building at the edge of the station and checked in with staff 4 times to inquire about the location of my bus. Again, I was told that my bus had not yet arrived but that we would be notified when it had. After waiting for 45 minutes in 90 degree weather, I approached the staff again and was told that I had missed my bus. The only other option for me to get home that night (at 10:30pm I might add) was to shell out another $90 for a ticket. I tried asking for help from customer service and from staff but was rudely shut down. I am very frustrated with this terrible and exhausting experience and will no longer utilize Flix when I am traveling. I strongly consider others to seek out other bus companies as it's clear that Flix has worked to cut as much of their operating budget as possible to provide the lowest quality experience on their buses.",5,HU,2024-07-07,Trustpilot

The refund process is not automatic, and you may have to jump through hoops to get your money back. It feels like a scam to get you to buy a more expensive ticket.

The customer support refused to acknowledge any responsibilities and refused to help me reach any civilized location to get to my destination (the service station was on a highway in the middle of nowhere).My luggages were onboard and I sent someone to collect them at the destination. When she asked the driver why they left me at the station and if she could take my luggages they said it was impossible, everybody was onboard and she could do whatever she wanted, they even didn't bother to ask her my ticket or ID.

I did not receive any notification that the bus would be delayed or cancelled. I called Flixbus several times and nobody answered.

Do NOT use this company,"In my experience Flixbus/ Greyhound is a predatory business that will rip you off, given the opportunity, There are many bad reviews written about Flixbus,I read them. And gave them a shot anyway. I accidentally ordered two tickets. I was told by a driver to contact customer service about an exchange/return. When asked if I can exchange or return one of them,I was told no, but they would give me less than 40 percent of the ticket in the form of a voucher.So I accidentally paid 50.00 cash for a ticket I can't use.And they give me back 17.00 in the form of a voucher for another trip.So they took 33.00 from me Because I accidentally ordered a ticket and force me to buy a voucher for 17.00.I could have spent that on Megabus and had a better experience. I highly recommend looking elsewhere for transportation. I think Flixbus is not the business you should deal with. They probably make a lot of money off of thier exchange/return policy, and I will never ride with them or their partner Greyhound ever again, no matter how much they beg me to risk my money and go on board with them again.

Reliable and on time,"I have travelled many times with Flixbus but this time I have to qualify this experience as bad and unpleasantFirst of all, this was the first time that the Flixbus app/website did not let me choose a seat even without paying an additional cost which is a usual service Flixbus offers, of course, proceed to buy the ticket as I had no problems with Flixbus in the past (For me this the trip start for me was already a bit not normal). Also, I would like to remark that drivers drove fast and in such a way that did not make the trip pleasant and more for an evening travel where highways are empty.I just wanted to remark on the above comments, but the real reason why I am rating this trip with flixbus as really bad is because on top of all this, when I arrived at my final destination I did not find my bag, the response from the bus driver when I told him was ""stupid people"", meaning that someone could have taken my bag, either accidentally or stolen, but to be honest I expected a more professional response from the Flixbus driver and he did not even guide me what to do, or even ask how the bag was etc, they just went away leaving me there at 2:20 am with a lost luggage. I of course proceeded to fill in the formulary on the Flixbus app for stolen/lost luggage. In addition to the personal belongings I lost, I would say that the treatment by the bus driver was not as expected for such a reputed company. It is an unpleasant experience that I would not wish on anyone. Now, I need to wait 14 days for a feedback from Flixbus. ",5,GB,2024-07-03,Trustpilot

The bus was clean and co.fortable,"Har brugt flixbus i et halvt √•r. Det er nemt at bestille billet og de overholder for det meste tidsplanen. Priser er fornuftige hvis man bestiller i god tid.

Man skal booke den ind, n√•r man bestiller billetten online. Dette var ikke muligt, s√• gik ud fra at den rute jeg tager ikke tilbyder denne mulighed. Det var ogs√• hvad jeg fik forklaret, da jeg chattede med en medarbejder. Bussen jeg tager har dog en cykelholder bagp√• bussen, s√• jeg sp√∏rger chauff√∏ren og han siger at busruten naturligvis tager cykler med. Jeg forklarede chauff√∏ren situationen og spurgte om jeg kunne f√• min cykel med. Det gav han ikke lov til, selvom der ingen cykler var i cykelholdene (plads til 3) og der ikke var nogle cykler booket ind p√• resten af ruten (spurgte ham). Jeg forklarede, at jeg gl√¶deligt ville betale selskabet og at tager ruten flere gange om m√•neden. Ligemeget hjalp det.

So a number of people had lost phone & their ticket access.  This bus was Sub-standard for extended travel!Given the opportunity to add to my review.  It is worth noting that it was chaos in Sacramento due to at least one bus cancellation & a number of people were being told they ""would have to rebook themselves"" to continue their travel. It sounded like a number of them were stuck until the next day.

A experi√™ncia foi positiva,"FlixBus could have been a great alternative to flights or trains for travel within the EU. However, the partnership with Kamil Ko√ß in Turkey falls significantly short of acceptable standards and is strongly not recommended. During our journey from Alanya to Istanbul, we accepted the lack of restroom facilities on the bus. However, what we could not accept was the disrespectful staff who did not speak a word of English. The staff were rude to our children, forbidding them from eating on the bus. Moreover, they accused us, the parents, of bad behavior and demanded we clean up a few crumbs left by our hungry children. Despite using Google Translate to communicate, they refused to listen and threatened to throw us off the bus. What kind of company tolerates such discriminatory and disrespectful behavior from its staff?They also did not stopped the passenger who recorded uss undrr discussion on bord.We are genuinely surprised that FlixBus, known for its child-friendly service, has partnered with a company that evidently does not screen its employees. Traveling with Kamil Ko√ß buses in Turkey is strongly not recommended. FlixBus should seriously reconsider continuing this partnership.Additionally, when we tried to contact customer service via WhatsApp, there was no one available who spoke English, making it difficult to file a complaint through their website. We are regular travelers with FlixBus, but we will no longer use their service in Turkey.",4,PT,2024-07-01,Trustpilot

On time but tired,"It is a mix feeling of review.I used Greygound over 20 years before they stopped the services in Ontario Canada. Not even 1 problem.Since I moved to London Ontario, I tried the bus going to & from Toronto airport. It appears to me that it is a cheap and comfortable way. What I didn't feel right was lacking customer services contact phone number, no clear bus station info on the website. Going to airport had no problem. I did ask the driver what happen if I missed the return bus or can I just take the next bus home (due to flight delay or whatever reason), his answer was NO.  On my return,they had changed the departure time 10 mins earlier 4:30 to 4:20pm. Unfortunately, my flight got delayed and I ran so hard tried to catch the 4:20pm bus but I was still 5 mins late. The bus left. I was not allow to change the bus schedule to next, I had no choice to rebook another one for over 40% more on the bus fare. I sent in my request for a refund, no reply for over 10 days and I contacted the live chat agent. Bojana of course was not able to help me for anything but direct me to a link for further help. The link is with unknown language, not English, not French, I told Bojana who insisted me just go to that link ???? as he/she was not able to provide any further help.  For this Company, I would say it is good when everything going good as your plan, however, DO NOT expect any help when something goes wrong, you are not going to have any assistance from this Company. Furthermore, when the bus stopped downtown drop off location, 3 people sneaked in the bus without paying, they looked like homeless people, of course the driver does not worth to do anything at that point.

Flixbus is for me the companie to travel with ,"We travelled with Flixbus in June 2024 and were absolutely horrified with the standard we received - from start to finish, it was a nightmare.Firstly, we were faced with a 3 hour 45 minute delay from Las Vegas to LA, with only a 20 minute notice period. There was little to no communication during this time, just the email to advise of the delay. The app also didn't provide any help as the arrival time of the bus kept moving. This meant we lost a full night in LA.During this time, temperatures had reached 108¬∞F in LV and there was no access to water with very little shelter available - there were elderly people and children present, which is completely unacceptable.When the bus finally arrived (3.75 hours later), it was filthy - infested with ants and roaches, which were falling through the vents and crawling on us from the ground.This wasn't acknowledged by the bus driver, who was generally rude and unapologetic - it also didn't help that his driving was erratic, which made a lot of the customers feel unsafe.Writing this, it's difficult to accurately describe how bad the experience was - there wasn't a single positive aspect of the journey.

In the end, the delay was less than 2 hours, and FlixBus refuses to refund the money, but I couldn't afford to wait two or more hours and risk missing our return flight.

Refund policy is very poor.","Viaggio con flixbus da pi√π di un anno.Mai avuto problemi di ritardi o di corse annullate.Gli autisti sono sempre super professionali ed educati, molto gentili e disponibili.In pi√π si preoccupano di far passare a tutti i passeggeri un piacevole viaggio, rimproverando chi non usa cuffie e di conseguenza disturba gli altri, o chi addirittura si leva le scarpe.Attenzione al cliente eccellente e anche simpatia.Ieri mi sono ritrovata alla stazione di Napoli dopo un viaggio di 16 ore con un altra compagnia partito da Torino in ritardo e arrivato a Napoli con 3 ore di ritardo.Il mio ragazzo alle 23 di sera √® rimasto bloccato a Napoli perch√© non c'erano pi√π mezzi pubblici e treni disponibili per raggiungere Afragola (a soli 20 minuti da Napoli).Gli autisti della compagnia che ha ritardato non ci hanno saputo dare n√© aiuto n√© indicazioni, neanche scusandosi per il notevole ritArdo.Gli autisti del flixbus che dovevo prendere per continuare il mio viaggio verso la Sicilia, invece, si sono dimostrati subito comprensivi e disponibili aiutando il mio ragazzo a trovare un taxi ad un prezzo accessibile per non lasciarlo a quell'ora di notte da solo in stazione.Non √© la prima volta che mi capita di trovare autisti qualificati che sanno lavorare con il pubblico, si vede che vengo formati bene.Grazie ancora!",1,MA,2024-06-29,Trustpilot
RIGOROSOS,"There was no Wi-Fi at all on the bus. I checked with the bus driver and he said call customer service. I checked with all of the other passengers, and none of them were able to get it either. I had planned to take the bus because I have a full day of work to do on my computer. I did this instead of using a car. The bus ride was two hours longer than if I drove, but I was willing to sacrifice the time for being efficient on the bus. Hopefully the company will refund my money even though unfortunately they cannot give me the time back. ",5,US,2024-06-29,Trustpilot

A cautionary tale- do not use Flixbus!,Where do I start first you guys need to give reimbursements for trips that you guys screw up secondly you need to get better phone operators thirdly need to get more professional employees fourthly you need to notify the person when you cancel the trip and fourthly if you cancel somebody's trip maybe not do it with somebody who has three tickets one of the worst experiences of my life also you guys need to get reimbursements and let people talk to supervisors when they call apparently they said they're not allowed to do that or give reimbursements even though they cost me so much money by making me late. Also I got extremely sick because the AC was broke on the bus and I had to cancel another trip positive and the only thing I got for all this was sorry and then apparently a guy riding the bus with me after I was told I couldn't talk to the supervisor he called talk to supervisor and got a reimbursement so that means the customer service lied to me. Do everything you can to avoid this company it's a million dollar company that does not want to help people whatsoever it doesn't matter it's all about the profit do not book through these guys I promise you they do not care about the customer period their line to change your schedule with no notice but if you miss your bus you got to buy a new ticket but yet if they screw you over don't get you somewhere on time you get no reimbursement nothing . DO NOT USE FLIXBUS FOR ANY REASON ,1,BR,2024-06-28,Trustpilot

Excelente servicio,"I have booked overnight bus to travel from Malmo to Stockholm using FlixBus.co.uk The price was fine and I managed to book window seat as it is the only way I could travel overnight and at least get some sleep. When I turned to the bus and was about to take my seat there was someone else there, questioning the person they say driver told them to seat there as there was a last minute change of the bus type and their seat was not existed in this type of the bus. When asking driver he wanted nothing to do with dealing with the issue and told me to contact FlixBus. They refunded my reservation fee but failed to address that I had to travel in the aisle for 8 hours overnight. I spoken to multiple agents about the incident but all they could do is to refund my reservation fee failing to acknowledge my frustration. I was expecting a small compensation for the inconvenience but it seems FlixBus does not care about customers concerns and comfort and that their bus drivers cannot deal effectively with incidents giving away your seats to someone else.",5,US,2024-06-28,Trustpilot

Absolute joke of a company ,"Avoid FlixBus at All Costs - Learn From My MistakesI had a terrible experience with FlixBus. We arrived at Rome Tiburtina bus station 30 minutes early for our 18:30 bus to Pescara. The information board said the bus would depart from stallo 8, but it never showed up.We asked the FlixBus attendant for help twice. He was rude and dismissive both times, offering no assistance. At 18:30, we checked the live tracker and saw that the bus had already left.After contacting customer service, I found out the bus was unmarked, and they failed to communicate this crucial information. Despite acknowledging their fault, they refused to issue a refund for the missed bus.This experience caused us significant stress, and we had to buy new tickets from another company to reach our destination.

Telephone support refused to take measures to avoid the loss of a backpack with things, because it seemed to them that I was not me. They asked to translate the dialogue into mail correspondence.

The duration of the stop was informed only once, in french, on a bus ride through spain, Italy and france. Maybe not everyone on the bus speaks french? ü§î I wasn't late because i was ordering coffee/buying a magazine: I was pulling my pants up in the bathroom, after waiting in line to use it. Heard a scream outside, in french, and left the bathroom booth as fast as humanly possible (faster than that, only with my pants down exposing private parts) and the bus wasn't there anymore! DETAIL: Not a toilet inside a big shop or convenience store, where you have no control over the passengers' whereabouts and they mix up with regular clients. It was a single bathroom booth, immediately in front of the parking lot, 10 meters away from the bus, without any other bus parked. A locked booth = someone inside! There was no counting of passengers. Problem number 2:Very polite phone representative tells me that even though she's sorry, they won't do anything for me. Even though I said ""I'm in the middle of the highway with no money, as a foreigner in a country I know no one and don't speak the language"". The message given was ""not our responsibility, we don't care"", but with very polite words now. Great improvement of costumer's service! Problem number 3: LOST LUGGAGE! allegedly they ""can't contact the driver of the bus, don't have his contact information. Fulfill a form on lost items"". Absolutely the same priority given to a lost pair of dark glasses. Yes, they won't warn the bus driver to leave my stuff on the next stop, 1h away! The bus driver will take my stuff to another country, thousands of miles away, even if I don't have a single extra piece of clothing with me and I'll still receive the same priority as someone that forgot their earphones. In a period of 14 days they will contact me to say if they found something. Can take up to two weeks just to compare the suitcase they found to the one in the photo I sent! A picture i took from the driver puting my suitcase inside the bus' luggage-compartment. I did it because I was aware of FLIXBUS' reputation, so I took a photo of all my belongings, since they don't provide a tag for you to withdraw your bags safely. It's like: you can't take any bag you want when leaving. Just book the cheapest flixbus trip and steal as many suitcases as you can carry ü§óExtra information: someone stole my bank card and money a couple of hours earlier, in the same bus.QUESTIONS TO FLIXBUS: - Are you aware that there is a facebook group with almost 7 thousand people called ""FLIXBUS NEVER AGAIN""? - how can an international transportation company, carrying passengers from all over the world through different countries, have their drivers delivering CRUCIAL INFORMATION with no repetition, in only one language (french in this case), in a very fast and incomprehensive way? Isn't it obvious that not everyone will be able to understand french? A pre-recorded message in other languages is that unreachable? A visual sign? A better training of the drivers? Counting the passengers? - I'm not an isolated case. I came across innumerous cases of people getting left behind and receiving no support.- can you please provide me any direct and personalized assistance on this urgent specific case, other than a vague empty response highlighting how ""everything is my own fault (even though flixbus is sorry), and that you have your policies and all I can do is wait""? Even though i don't have my clothes, toothbrush or work material? Are you going to try and get your client back by changing my mind or just ignore more bad publicity? Be aware that your reputation could be better: I don't speak any french but I'm pretty sure that the opinion of the policeman that almost detained me for being walking on the side of the highway had about flixbus was pretty horrible.",4,FR,2024-06-26,Trustpilot

Recommend others not to book in advance with Flix! Expect timetables to be flexible, there is no real time app operated by Flix and information on Flix bus arrivals at Porto airport is poor.

Alt klappede,"Extremely disappointed with FlixBus and my recent dealings with their driver on line 910 Bristol Airport to Swansea (reg plate BR210CU) . I bought a ticket to the 5:35 bus from Bristol Airport to Cardiff, but due to past minute change in my circumstances, I arrived in Bristol around 2pm, so asked the driver if there is a way to amend the ticket and if he can take me on this bus, as otherwise I had to wait 3.5h for the next one. He was extremely rude and he said that I don't have the right ticket to be on this bus and have to wait for my bus, eventhough the bus was almost empty. He said that he has 27 seats left and he is picking up 26 people from Bristol, which meant that there was one extra seat, but he still wouldn't take me. Never using FlixBus again, as in similar situations in the past National Express and MegaBus have always been very understanding and accommodating, so I know who I'm travelling with next time...",5,US,2024-06-25,Trustpilot

Very comfortable and professional ,"There were no real issues with the trip, and I love the low prices and convenience. However, the bus was filthy - there were bottles half full of soda, etc on the floor in front of the seat next to me, and every cup holder was filled with trash.  Also, this is the third time I've ridden Flixbus and the second time the driver has acted inappropriately, in my opinion. The complaint is identical, so maybe the same driver? Before we left the terminal,  she stood in the middle of the bus and hollered at everyone - EVERYONE - for a good while.  Apparently a rider had been loud before I got on. Her speech was unprofessional and bossy. A couple times after making a point, she looked around, making eye contact, asking,""Ok?"" and if met with silence, ""OKAY?!"" I am not a child - I'm a paying customer. I mean, not after today tho. I have to go home, but not after that. She is for sure on a power trip and doesn't know how to assert herself except to threaten to leave individuals on the side of the road.  This is unacceptable and dangerous.

I didn't hear anything for 3 weeks. Then I received an email saying that in order to be considered for a refund I need to provide the receipts for all items included in the bag, which I do not have.Two days later I received finally positive feedback that they found my bag, and I just need to pay 29,90 EUR and provide my address so that the bag can be  dispatched to me. And I will be informed once it is shipped via DHL.  I payed for the delivery and provided my address within a hour.  That was 11 day ago, and nothing happened.

Bag was stolen/lost - Unpleasant Journey,"Flixbus storniert Reisen und verursacht ungeplante Mehrkosten! Daher halte ich Flixbus f√ºr unzuverl√§ssig.Meine Beschwerde an Flixbus blieb erfolglos:¬´HalloIch bin sehr ver√§rgert √ºber Ihren ¬´Kundendienst¬ª und m√∂chte Sie ersuchen, zu folgenden Beschwerden und Fragen Stellung zu nehmen:1. Ich hab bei Ihnen ein Ticket gekauft, Buchungsnr.: 3141470824, und bekam kurz vor dem Reisetag und nur per SMS Bescheid, dass Sie diese Fahrt storniert haben.2. Im Chat mit Ihrem ¬´Kundendienst¬ª bot man mir entweder eine Umbuchung auf die Fahrt um 06:00 Uhr aus Zagreb an, was f√ºr mich inakzeptabel fr√ºh gewesen w√§re, oder eine R√ºckerstattung.3. Ich schaute mich nach alternativen Verbindungen um und stellte fest, dass Sie doch eine Fahrt um 14:00 Uhr haben werden, aber nur bis Belgrad. Diese Fahrt zu buchen h√§tte mehr gekostet als die R√ºckerstattung, also fragte ich im Chat nach, ob mein bestehendes Ticket wenigstens bis Belgrad g√ºltig sein wird. Mehrfach wurde mir best√§tigt, dass dies so sein wird.4. Beim Einstieg in den Bus stellte sich heraus, dass mein Ticket dem Fahrer doch als ung√ºltig angezeigt wurde! Und ich war nicht auf seiner Liste der Fahrg√§ste. Also genau, was ich bef√ºrchtet hatte! Und obschon ich mehrmals bat, mir bitte (per Mail) zu best√§tigen, dass mein Ticket von Zagreb nach Belgrad g√ºltig sein wird! Sie haben mir dies im Chat mehrfach best√§tigt.5. Ich bekam √ºbrigens sowohl gestern (um 10:07 Uhr) wie auch heute (um 09:39 Uhr) von Ihnen Info-Mails, wo die gesamte bezahlte Strecke, also von Zagreb nach Ni≈° aufgef√ºhrt war! Auch in der App steht noch die ganze Stecke. Dies sind extreme Fehlinfomationen, denn in der Tat werde ich selber schauen m√ºssen, wie ich von Belgrad nach Ni≈° gelange und zwar auf eigene Kosten, obschon Sie mir ein Ticket bis nach Ni≈° verkauft haben.Warum haben Sie mich im Chat mehrfach falsch informiert? Das Ticket war n√§mlich nicht g√ºltig und ich musste mit dem Busfahrer eine L√∂sung suchen. Er hat dann zumindest organisiert, dass ich ein neues Ticket bis Belgrad erhalte.Warum haben Sie mich gestern und heute per Mail falsch informiert, obschon da schon feststand, dass Sie nur bis Belgrad fahren werden?Diese Unzuverl√§ssigkeiten machen mich sehr w√ºtend. Sie sollten mir zumindest ungef√§hr anteilig die Kosten f√ºr die Strecke Belgrad ‚Äì Ni≈° erstaten.

The bathroom is always clean and the drivers are polite despite having an upset traveler from time to time. The price is the absolute lowest price to be found and that rate is at it's lowest if you book 10days in advance.

Good way to go from Philly to NYC,"I bought 4 tickets on Flixbus and never got them on my email. So I messaged the customer service asking to send me my tickets because I definitely paid for it. One week took to investigate if I really bought these tickets. When I asked a few times they finally sent me my tickets. My husband and I came to the bus station 20 mins earlier. We always come earlier so we never had problems. We came and saw no one. This was very suspicious because there are always people waiting for a bus. We waited 40 mins. Still no one came! Then I checked the schedule on their site and CAN YOU IMAGINE??The time of departure of the bus according to schedule and on my tickets WAS DIFFERENT. There was NO BUS the time mentioned on my OFFICIAL TICKETS! So the bus left 30 mins earlier according to the schedule. My bus LEFT 30 mins earlier!I messaged the custom service and Rodwel from FlixBus messaged me that:Please be assure that we have checked your case carefully. After careful verification, we can see that your trip from Li√®ge Guillemins to Aachen station west (Henricistra√üe) on Saturday, 08 Jun 2024 was operated as scheduled. We can also see that other passengers were able to board the bus that departed from the same location. No refund is possible.CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT??Of course my bus left according to the schedule!!

Great service‚Ä¶,"Scrivo per rendere noto a tutti della mia disavventura a bordo del N1550. Sono scesa a Cosenza dal bus Flixbus intorno alle 10:05 (il pullman sarebbe dovuto arrivare a Cosenza alle 9:25 ma quel giorno c'era un'incidente) e nemmeno venti minuti dopo riscontro tante e diverse punture da cimici dei letti su braccia, gambe e piedi (confermati sia dai farmacisti del mio paese che dalla mia Dottoressa di base). Ricordo perfettamente il momento in cui, intorno alle ore 21:00 del giorno precedente trovai un insetto camminare sul sedile di fronte a me e lo schiacciai sperando tra me e me che non fosse una cimice. Mi dissi che era ""solo un insetto"", che forse ero esagerata io. Ma mi sono ampiamente ricreduta.E, tra le altre cose, non √® neppure la prima volta che mi capita. √à capitato anche nel mio precedente viaggio Cosenza-Milano, volevo sperare che fosse stata un'eccezione ma questa volta √® pure peggio.

Good Travel,"I wish there was a zero star rating because that's what Flixbus deserves. On Sunday 09/06/24, I booked a bus from Aberdeen to Edinburgh with a transfer at Perth. On reaching Dundee, the bus broke down and the driver said those of us transferring should get on another bus service and call the office for a refund, which sounded fair.Today, I'm callng Flixbus customer service and the unprofessional attendant said she was not aware of such breakdown and would not give a refund. No empathy. It's really annoying because I have had a series of terrible experiences with Flixbus in the last 2 weeks. On Friday, 07/06/24 my flixbus trip from Edinburgh (booking # 3167390710) was delayed for more than 2 hours. I couldn't wait for it and had to book Citylink to Aberdeen, spending extra unbudgeted amount.The week before, precisely on 31/05/2024, my trip from Edinburgh (Booking # 3165495637) was cancelled. I got a text message only a couple of hours before the trip advising me to re-book or ask for a refund. I had to change the booking to an earlier time, to take off from a different departure location  - Ingliston. As a result, I had to take a taxi to catch up with the bus, another unplanned expense plus the stress and anxiety of missing the bus. All because someone decided to cancel at me within short notice. I wrote Flixbus an email concerning this and I was ignored. Having gone through these distasteful experiences because of Flixbus, a customer service assistant has the effontry to be cheeky when i asked for a refund? What nonsense!I will never use Flixbus again and will make sure everyone i know don't experience the series of disappointments and poor customer service i received.It's the end of a woeful bus service for me.

Fast cheap booking and the drivers are‚Ä¶,"My 5 year old and I missed our 1pm bus by 10 seconds!! I was told I could wait for the next one that came a half hour later. I waited for the next bus and waited patiently on the line when it arrived. When I got to the driver, I showed him my ticket and explained to him what happened. I asked if there were extra seats on the bus, could I board with my son. He yelled at me very loudly and said ""NO!!! This is NOT the 1pm, this is the 1:30!!!"" and continued to brush me off. One of the other workers walked over to me and said it was basically up to the driver and would see what he could do. The driver proceeded to tell him that he would let me on the bus for $70 cash. Unfortunately, I didn't have the cash but said I would buy the ticket online. When I said that, the driver got back in the bus, and closed the doors. The other worker said he wasn't going to wait for me. It was an overall very distasteful experience. My son and I had traveled an hour and a half from upstate to get the bus, only to be mistreated and yelled at by a grown man while with my 5 year old. I was offered to wait for the 3:45pm bus, but couldnt see myself having another horrible experience with my child. I passed up the opportunity to visit my family because of how the driver treated me.

Reliable and convenient.,"Hello,So let me start by saying that I swore a while back not to bother with greyhound, and then I find out you both merged? I decided on trying you..best decision I've ever made, I wanted to ride flix back and forth from and to my destination! Trust me I kept my fingers crossed! Especially after my encounter with "" Tony"" .this driver was very professional very helpful, any questions asked , he had answers. He made sure to Keep track of his passengers, as to look around and ask if everyone was back on bus before we departed any stops. His mannerism with most respect and concern with his passengers well being, was so refreshing...I've encountered very very rude drivers after having ridden greyhound for over 20 yrs.My name is Rosa Lirely. You can check and see how long I've been a customer. This last ride to Charlotte NC from Atlanta, on May 26,may 26 was when my encounter with this awesome driver took place.on my way back I had a long layover in Orlando, I happened to see him, and I thanked him once again for his hospitality and concern for us. Even though I was no longer his passenger, while in Orlando he reassured all will be well!Flix thanks! For first providing "" Tony"" to take care of us, and providing the best service ever!

Hade bokat och betalat sittplatser b√•de‚Ä¶,"On 6 June 2024, the Flix Bus driver from a connecting bus 1304 failed to collect five passengers from Zone B in Brussels, Boulevard Roi Albert II, Place Solvay. My elderly mother has been told by another unrelated Flix Bus driver, who was kind enough to explain what had gone on, that the 1304 driver confirmed he had failed to collect us and headed to Warsaw without us. The driver, 1304, must have stopped at a distance at the above stop at around 20:55 due to high traffic. Because his vehicle was not marked adequately with the number 1304, the five passengers could not identify the correct vehicle and assumed they had to continue waiting. They waited at the stop from 19:30. The driver 1304 had not called out for missing passengers at any point in any language, resulting in them being stranded overnight. Most of them were Ukrainian speakers. I personally bought another Flix Bus ticket for my mother, 3167682244, to travel the next morning to Lviv and ask for a refund of this new ticket, ¬£118.96, as well as a full refund for the missed opportunity to travel on the old reservation, 3147543674, ¬£101.77. All the stranded passengers realised they were stranded at around 22:30; all were women, some elderly. They were all at risk and in distress and had to spend a night in the street waiting for the next bus at 09:00 the next morning. I would never recommend that anyone travel to Poland by a Flix Bus.P.S. Afterall, one passenger had a 'friend' (a student in Brussels, 57 Weggevoerdenstraat) who asked her hostel admin staff to assist with arranging an overnight stay. The hostel accepted and collected the women from the Flix Bus stop after 1 AM, and they are now safe after all. It would be nice if Flix Bus could organise direct routes without so many connecting busses. Otherwise, it would be impossible to continue using the service. ************ Thank you for your response below******, but it fails to resolve the problem and fails to even admit the fact that the connecting driver has not stopped, or if stopped has not collected the five passengers: Hello Kateryna,Thank you for taking the time to contact us.We would like to apologize for this inconvenience caused.After checking carefully, we could confirm that the bus left on time and all the other passengers have been checked in. The passengers with the same information as you managed to take the trip, and we could confirm that the bus stopped at the correct station.According to our Terms & Conditions, under 5.6 Connections with transfers (interconnections) are treated as one journey.In this case, since you have taken the first part of the trip and missed the second bus, the refund would not be applicable since it is one ticket. If a trip is cancelled or on departure there is a delay more than 120 minutes from the scheduled departure time and a customer withdraws from the trip, a refund can be claimed. Once you decide to board the bus i.e. the contract was fulfilled, refunding or compensation is not possible. That also goes for any delays that occur during your bus ride.We regret that we cannot meet your request in this case and hope for your understanding. We would appreciate the opportunity to convince you of our reliability and therefore hope to have you aboard.Kind Regards,Leonita from FlixBus",1,DE,2024-06-17,Trustpilot

Flixbus er et godt alternativ til DSB, hvor du slipper for menneskemylder inde p√• stationerne og ikke mindst, for DSB's monopol overpriser. Kan kun anbefale Flixbus, og vi k√∏rer gerne med jer igen.

One staff said I can cancel you ticket boldly do to a misunderstanding. One security officer told some one to get the f word out of the buildings.

It was fast and easy,"The power didn‚Äôt work. The driver said she would fix it at the next stop, but whatever she did had no effect.Even if the power did work, it would have been of limited usefulness. There was no socket at each seat as advertised. The nearest socket to my seat was 2 rows away, too far for a power cable to reach, and would have been shared with at least half a dozen other passengers.The WiFi didn‚Äôt work either.There were also display screens above some of the seats, which apparently didn‚Äôt work for whatever their intended purpose was, because printed out pages were taped over then to provide information like the password for the (non-working) WiFi.And halfway through the trip, the driver told us that there was something wrong with the AC, and it was going to get very hot heading into LA, so everyone should take off their jackets and whatever else they feel appropriate taking off. She did apologize, and promise to get it fixed after the she returned to the yard before the next trip, but that hardly helped any of us.My previous trip on 10 May also had no WiFi and no AC (although at least that trip had working lower, and sockets at every seat). Flix responded to my complaint, and my TrustPilot review, by saying they‚Äôd reviewed the case and agreed that the problems were unacceptable, but they offered no compensation of any kind. Instead, they concluded that ‚ÄúWe are confident that yours was a one-off experience, therefore we are looking forward to the opportunity to welcome you aboard again so we can restore your faith in our service and improve your impression of FlixBus in future journeys with us.‚Äù I gave them that opportunity, and it obviously did not restore my faith, as my next trip had both of the same problems plus a new one.On top of everything else, the prices have gone way up since they bought out and dismantled all their competitors. A trip that cost $32 in late 2021 now costs $91 ($46 one way, $41 the other way, both including ‚Äúall applicable taxes and fees‚Äù, but another $4 of taxes and ‚Äúservice fees‚Äù are added anyway).",5,HU,2024-06-14,Trustpilot

Both legs were pretty poor, but this particular journey exceeded expectations of poor service.Whilst the comments regarding the first leg I reviewed on TrustPilot that Greyhound provided may have sounded like good intent, the reality is it takes time and effort to solve issues, and will. We took the bus back yesterday from NYC to DC, with all of the same issues as the trip to get here. Again, no signage to say where to go so customers were wandering around, a disinterested driver when we did find him, no cup holders, no WiFi, no power to charge anything, no washing facilities in the toilet - all very poor service. Worst of all, we had booked tickets to take us to Arlington, and when we got to Central Station the driver said he wasn't going any further and we would need to find our own way to Arlington.

Um 00:40 Uhr kam der Bus N401 in Z√ºrich an, jedoch war dieser v√∂llig √ºberf√ºllt.

easy booking,"I had a terrible experience with TUFESA that resulted in me almost missing my holiday for a trip travelling from San Jose to Fresno. I booked the ticket by phone. The agent was friendly and told me the pick up time and location.When I got there 15 mins earlier, I saw the bus leaving right in front of my eyes, so I called the agent immediately, but they let me wait for 25 mins and so I couldn't talk to anyone to seek more information.In the end, I had to ask my husband to drive me there. On the way to Fresno, I called the agent again, and finally they picked up. Upon explaining the situation, they told me they got both the WRONG PICK UP LOCATION and WRONG PICK UP TIME, and apologised half hearted. I was upset but I focused on solving the problem, so I asked if I can still take the bus in the next pick up point at Gilroy. She said I can do that, because at this point she said the bus is running late (i don't know how that is possible but I just want to catch the bus so didn't ask more!!) and I can get to Gilroy before them.So we drove to Gilroy only to be told by the people working at the station that the bus has left 45 mins ago and my poor husband now has to drive 3 hours to take me to Fresno!!!!!! At this point I was furious and deeply disappointed.I called the agent again, and she apologised with little sympathy or little sense of responsibility. When I expressed my frustration and asked for a refund for a trip I didn't take, she refused, saying that is the policy. They are lucky I didn't ask for a compensation!So in the end she said her manager will call back and write a report for the incident in 72 hours. It has been 6 days, never got the phone call.

I took one from Krak√≥w, Poland to Budapest, Hungary; got to the bus station an hour early and waited at the platform they told me to wait at. The driver showed up two platforms over, never shouted anything, no announcement on the intercom, just loaded a bunch of people in and left me and someone else behind. No refund, no reply from Flixbus, and I had to spend $50 more for a 7 1/2 hr ride (3 hrs more) AND wait three more hours for the next bus. WiFi also didn't work and the a/c was barely on so it was hot and stuffy the whole way through. Driver never stopped for lunch either, just a ten minute break so make sure you pack a lunch or you'll starve.Better to fly or take the train next time. Don't use unless you're budget is so tight you can't afford anything else otherwise just splurge with something else, it's worth it! Edit: reply for 7 June 2024 - ""We can confirm that the bus left from the stop indicated on your ticket PDF file, and therefore in accordance to our Terms and Conditions.."" The bus driver did NOT stop at C14 as indicated on the board at the station and I'm not making this up nor am I mistaken. In fact someone else had the same issue too.

It was very easy and straight forward,"Per motivi lavorativi ho dovuto utilizzare i servizi offerti da Flixbus. li ho trovati molto convenienti a discapito qualche volta della non comodit√† dei sedili. Tuttavia gli autisti sono molto professionali e gentili. Ho effettuato le prenotazioni sia online, via desktop che con app. Molto intuitivo il tutto, ma proporrei di apportare una modifica all'app che consenta di memorizzare oltre ai ticket personali, anche i vaucher In questo modo i vaucher direttamente memorizzati potrebbero essere utilizzati per gli acquisti successivi. Potrebbe riportare anche un eventuale saldo positivo da sfruttare per prenotazioni future (tipo Account Amazon).",4,DE,2024-06-13,Trustpilot

Nice travels always, I was just left stranded in the middle of no where at a gas station in Germany while the bus was on a pause that we we told would be for 10 minutes. As soon as they switched drivers the bus left without announcing or even letting us know and after 5 minutes only. I tried speaking to the driver that I am now left stranded in the middle of no where and he was very rude and aggressive. I am now running to find a train to get home somehow as I was headed to cologne and I lost all my belongings and clothings etc as the bus left with 2 suitcases of mines.

Easy,"Am 16. Dezember 2018 fuhr ein Bus im Auftrag von Flixbus von Genua nach D√ºsseldorf. Der Fahrer rief im Flixbus-Verkehrszentrum an und bat darum, die Fahrt abzubrechen, da er die vereisten Stra√üen und die schlechten Sichtverh√§ltnisse als zu riskant einsch√§tzte. Flixbus lehnte dies ab und bestand auf die Weiterfahrt. 45 Minuten sp√§ter verungl√ºckte der Bus auf der vereisten Stadtautobahn von Z√ºrich und forderte zwei Todesopfer. Diese egoistische Entscheidung zeigt die mangelnde R√ºcksichtnahme auf die Sicherheit der Fahrg√§ste und Fahrer.Richtig dreist wird es nun im Nachhinein, denn die Flixbus-Pressestelle lie√ü am 29.05.2024 gegen√ºber SRF verlauten: ""Die Sicherheit unserer Fahrg√§ste und Fahrer hat f√ºr Flix damals 2018 wie heute allerh√∂chste Priorit√§t.""

Se si prova a contattare un operatore via chat, il messaggio viene letto ma nessuno risponde (ho atteso anche oltre 10 minuti).

You get what you pay for,"Bus ""station"" is just an area on the street, poorly marked with nowhere to sit or protection from the elements.

There were at least 2 separate people still on the bus who didn't even know they'd reached their destination. There's no apparent rule about eating, and clearly a number of people on the bus were, but he kept yelling at my wife not to, and obviously insulting her, because she was in the front row.  The crew seemed to be very unhappy with their jobs and taking it out on the passengers. The wifi was terrible and was either simply slow or dropped and refused to connect.

So my one-way ticket to Grenoble cost 39 Euros from the machine.I could book my return ticket to the airport online as I knew my time of departure from Grenoble, and this was 12 Euros which I thought very reasonable.One small point: here in the UK the drivers of airport coaches stow away the luggage in the hold, whereas with Flixbus (or generally in France?) the passengers had to struggle to get their sometimes heavy suitcases into the hold themselves, and retrieve them on arrival.On balance, a good experience.",4,US,2024-06-11,Trustpilot

This normally wouldn't have been a problem, however due to the change in pick up location I guess we got there 20 minutes earlier than scheduled and so we sat there, on the bus, not allowed to get off.

Quick and easy process,"I usually have a good experience with Flix but Sat May 25 was not good. I was traveling from Rome Tibutina to L'Aquila. I was checking the board and L'Aquila never came up on the board. Ancorra was there but no L'Aquila. I have no idea what Ancorra is or where it is. I checked but couldn't see the number for the bus at the angle I was looking at the board and had a sore neck to begin with. I went to the Flix office several times but the same people were at the desk for over 45 minutes. The clerk wasn't in any hurry when he saw the line forming. Many of us came and went several times. I spoke to the woman in front of me and she needed to buy a ticket before she missed the bus. The clerk at the counter finally looked up and asked me if I had a problem. I said yes the problem was that he had been with the same customer for over 45 minutes and I only had 15 minutes to find out where my bus was boarding. He yelled at me that it is called customer service and that THEY were buying 20 tickets and how many was I buying. I told him customer service was taking care of ALL the customer and since I had already paid for my ticket I now needed some. He said there were other bus companies that went to L'Aquila and maybe I should use them!! I came to find out that the board should have said L'Aquila/ Ancorra because the Ancorra part was added on when the bus to there, broke down and was added to the L'Aquila route. So back the the clerk. Maybe someone needs to tell this guy that after a few trans actions...they were buying 2 tickets at a time..he should ask them to wait a minute and take care of the line. And also, maybe a few lessons in manners. You can be sure on my next trip to Rome I will take his suggestion and try another bus company. I hear Gasspari is lovely!!!",5,US,2024-06-10,Trustpilot

The bus is comfortable with lot of space for legs, but as it was late and the trip was after the other one arrived, the cleaning was not optimal.

Cuando llego mi autob√∫s, el conductor ya sali√≥ de malas maneras, gritando a todo el que le preguntaba algo. Yo entiendo que uno puede tener un mal dia, pero no se puede ir gritando por las estaci√≥n para que la gente que coge este autob√∫s sepa que ya a llegado. Como ejemplo una mujer de edad con toda educaci√≥n le pregunto si el autob√∫s iba a Barcelona y este en vez de responderle que no educadamente le respondi√≥ gritando. Estaba alucindando.En mi caso le pregunte al conductor si habr√≠a posibilidades de bajar en Donosti en vez de Hendaya.

The worst trip l ever had,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of traveling with FlixBus from Dubrovnik to Split, and it was undoubtedly the worst 4-hour journey of my life. We were assigned 6 seats in the most cramped and suffocating area of the bus, on the lower floor next to the toilet. This section of the bus only had 8 seats, and it was clear that this area was not designed for a comfortable travel experience.The cleanliness of the bus was appalling. Upon boarding, we found food bits scattered on the seats and tables, and the air was thick with a suffocating smell. To make matters worse, the odor from the toilet next to our seats was unbearable. Throughout the journey, passengers frequently used the toilet, which only exacerbated the already terrible smell.We informed the bus driver about the situation at the first stop, but he was helpless and simply said, ""I know.""Enduring this for four hours was an ordeal. The proximity to the toilet and no ventilation made it almost impossible to breathe comfortably. This experience was far from what one would expect when paying for a bus ticket, and it felt like we were subjected to substandard conditions despite paying the same fare as everyone else.I strongly believe that these seats should not be allocated to any passengers. It's unfair and unacceptable to subject anyone to such discomfort and poor conditions. I hope FlixBus takes this feedback seriously and makes necessary changes to improve the travel experience for all passengers.",1,US,2024-07-16,Trustpilot
Very easy and convenient,"Book a seat reservation to avoid any confusion about where you will be sitting! The money saved by not reserving a seat is not worth the seat drama I witnessed among couples who got on and could not sit together or people who sat in seats that turned out to be reserved by other people who got on at a later stop. This was my trip from NYC Port Authority to Montr√©al after Amtrak unexpectedly cancelled the route due to track service. The trip length and timing actually worked out better than the original plan logistically. Leaving at midnight from NYC to arrive in the morning gave me more time to get settled when I arrived in Montreal. If you‚Äôre able to wait until the second stop, and don‚Äôt want to use the bathroom on the coach, listen to the driver advice to walk a little bit to Stewart‚Äôs in Plattsburgh for the restroom stop because everyone will be on line at the Dunkin Donuts building.

Limpesa e casa de banho,"This was extremely terrible experience with Flixbus. We bought ticket from Split to Plitvicka Jezera bus station. When the bus stopped before and at the Jezera bus station, I had shown bus driver my Flixbus ticket and asked him over three times (at each different station) that if this was the station to get off the bus. But the driver always replied ‚Äì ‚Äúnext station‚Äù. When I saw the bus passed Jezera bus station, the driver said to us that bus could not stop here and he had to continue drove to next stop. He also said that when he turned back he would drop us off Jezera bus station. Before the driver turning the bus back at Flixbus Bus Stop North station, I had shown the driver our booked ‚ÄúHotel Jezera‚Äù and he replied that he knew it. When the bus returned to Jezera bus station, the driver stopped said hello to other truck driver. We thought the driver would drop us off. But the bus driver did not open the door at Jezera bus station and continue driving away from Jezera bus station. We asked him to stop but he refused and had intentionally drove us further 1.7 KM away to Mukinje bus station then kicking us off the bus. This was at the nowhere of the country site & we (as elderly people) had no idea for how to go to the hotel with two suitcases. Fortunately someone at Mukinje bus station helped us & called local taxi to transfer us to our hotel. This Flixbus driver is extremely rude in which he has not only failed to deliver passenger to ticked destination but also uses his driver power to abuse elderly passenger. I had made complains to Flixbus same day and received response after two days. Flixbus customer service called this terrible inhuman activity was just an ‚Äúinconvenience‚Äù occasion. This could be the reason of the bus driver was able to do such bad thing.

This time bus was generally on time. I found their App useful to track the bus, noticing construction traffic was delaying bus a few minutes. My recommendation based on two experiences is: Be ready for bus to be delayed due to traffic, if bus is on time that is great. Use their App as needed for ticket management and bus tracking. And be flexible in your plans. Seat reservations are nice but my experience is other people without reservations can sit anywhere. You can decide how to handle that situation. The double decker bus I took to Strasbourg was clean and what I expected. It stopped at a gas station.

If this is not against the law in Belgium & France, it should be. The driver told me when I spoke to him on arrival that his boss had a problem in the office & he was under pressure to reply. In that case the boss should be suspended or the policy of Flixbus on road safety should be changed immediately. People are killed on roads all over Europe & the world due to drivers texting & using phones in other ways. The driver was very good at his job otherwise & apologised to me when I spoke to him about texting afterwards.

Do not ride with Marie in the Northeast U.S if you have a choice. - I have a medical condition (IBS) that was not only not accommodated (lack of bathroom access, threats for using a rest stop, threats for eating and drinking etc) but exacerbated by a stressful police encounter- Bus left almost 90 minutes late due the driver's attitude.-Tickets were not scanned. -The driver banned people from sitting in the front 4 rows (where I had assigned seats) and told others to ignore seat bookings leading to boarding chaos.-The driver threatened to throw people off the bus for bringing on board food/water for the 4 hour journey.-The driver locked the bathroom and said it was out of order.- The driver was prepared to leave to passengers behind at a rest stop.-When another passenger asked to wait 5 minutes for someone returning from the bathroom, the driver called the police to remove the passenger who questioned her. - This caused another 45 minute delay and a large number of passengers were kicked off the bus. - I arrived at my destination multiple hours late at which point public transit was no longer running to allow me to easily get to my home. Ultimately, the bus driver was rude, belligerent and created an environment where multiple passengers voiced feeling unsafe. The stressful situation caused me significant pain but after watching the police called on a passenger for asking for a 5 minute wait, I did not feel comfortable leaving the bus to use a rest stop nor could I eat small snacks to alleviate my stomach.

The other flixbus drivers were very unhelpful. Nothing else was offered. The next flixbus was in 2 hours. I was alone and it was cold and getting dark. Terrible experience for a solo female traveler. I hoped to at least get a refund but what did I get instead - a 25% voucher??? That is only valid for a month??? This sounds like a joke. I kindly ask to fully cover the price of my ticket. I wanted to add another review about my previous travel but it seems I can only write one review. The previous flixbus was so disgustingly dirty. Old,  stinky foodrests everywhere, mud everywhere, the seats broken and stinky, the seats near the toilet were unbearable. The air-conditioners didnt work to make it worse. This is worse than public transport. Clean the buses!!!PS Thank you for the answer and the refund",4,AU,2024-06-03,Trustpilot

En (Flix)bus de Barcelona Toulouse,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of traveling with FlixBus from Dubrovnik to Split, and it was undoubtedly the worst 4-hour journey of my life. We were assigned 6 seats in the most cramped and suffocating area of the bus, on the lower floor next to the toilet. This section of the bus only had 8 seats, and it was clear that this area was not designed for a comfortable travel experience.The cleanliness of the bus was appalling. Upon boarding, we found food bits scattered on the seats and tables, and the air was thick with a suffocating smell. To make matters worse, the odor from the toilet next to our seats was unbearable. Throughout the journey, passengers frequently used the toilet, which only exacerbated the already terrible smell.We informed the bus driver about the situation at the first stop, but he was helpless and simply said, ""I know.""Enduring this for four hours was an ordeal. The proximity to the toilet and no ventilation made it almost impossible to breathe comfortably. This experience was far from what one would expect when paying for a bus ticket, and it felt like we were subjected to substandard conditions despite paying the same fare as everyone else.I strongly believe that these seats should not be allocated to any passengers. It's unfair and unacceptable to subject anyone to such discomfort and poor conditions. I hope FlixBus takes this feedback seriously and makes necessary changes to improve the travel experience for all passengers.",5,NL,2024-06-03,Trustpilot

pricing,"On April 28, 2024, I traveled from Paris (Bercy Seine) to London (Victoria Coach Station) via a FlixBus service, with a departure time of 10:15 (Paris time) and an arrival time of 18:55 (London time). My booking reference number for this particular trip is 315 443 4163, route 700.Unfortunately, upon my arrival in London, I realized that I had inadvertently left my suitcase in the luggage compartment of the bus. The suitcase in question is a medium-sized black one with four wheels, displaying some minor scratches, and branded ""Newcom.""Immediately upon recognizing my mistake, I hastened back to the station within a mere 10 minutes, only to find that the bus had already left. Despite my swift actions to retrieve the suitcase, which included visiting the station on the evening of April 28 and again on April 29, as well as lodging a report with FlixBus's lost and found department (report reference number: 37302145), there have been no updates or leads regarding its whereabouts.It has now been more than two weeks since my first contact with the lost and found service. The inability to find my suitcase, which was left in the luggage compartment of your bus, for such an extended period is unacceptable. This lack of professionalism on your part is simply unacceptable.I vividly remember the driver who operated the route and have provided all relevant details. Despite suggesting the possibility of contacting the bus driver, FlixBus declined to do so, citing privacy concerns. While I acknowledge my own error in leaving the suitcase behind, I am profoundly dissatisfied with FlixBus's approach to resolving this matter. I believe the company's actions‚Äîor lack thereof‚Äîcould be construed as negligence. Consequently, I am considering taking legal action to address this situation.",5,DE,2024-06-02,Trustpilot

Fast service and accurate service from‚Ä¶,"The level of accountability (or lack thereof) tells me the buses are probably much less punctual than the advertised 9/10, otherwise, they would've been embarrassed by the experience we had using this service.Had a flight from London Gatwick at 11:45AM. Because the first train from Liverpool would've gotten me there just past 9, I didn't want to risk it, so I opted for a 00:50 Flixbus. In theory, it should've given me enough time, with a 6:30 arrival to London Victoria, and roughly 7:30 to Gatwick. In theory.The bus was initially late for over an hour. We departed Liverpool at 02:17. Each station later was an even bigger delay. Eventually, the delay was so big that I had a choice, risk being late for flight check in, or just get off two stops earlier (Heathrow) and Uber to Gatwick. I took the latter, which turned out to be a good choice, but costing me an additional ¬£80. Adding that to the ticket cost for two people, we could've easily gotten a return train ticket and get there before we got there using that Uber. Punctuality 0/5 The bus itself was poorly air conditioned. The entire bus smelled like urine. One would think that an overnight bus should be cozy enough, but no. It was drafty and cold, with the former being completely useless for the urine smell. So we spent 6 hours being cold and inhaling urine. Conditions 0.1/5And now for the most frustrating thing - accountability. The drivers at some point just gave up. When I asked one what the estimate was, I just got ""pffft...no idea...maybe hour, hour and a half"", at the point of it being late over and hour already. Good thing we didn't rely on his estimate cause it was way over in the end. Moving on to customer service - the refund asays ""120 min delay along with any other costs attached"", HOWEVER, it comes with so many strings attached, that it's a harp, not a refund policy. You can't get money back, just a voucher, and only if you don't board the bus (!?). Also, the additional costs cover (and I quote) ""reasonable alternatives like another bus or 2nd class trains"". So, you're supposed to jump through hoops to get a modicum of accountability for a massive blunder. It's not like they're cheating you out of the refund, but let's be honest - the surface level of accountability is hiding absolute rot underneath. -1,000,000/5I will never ever EVER use Flixbus again. Not so much because of the bus being late, but because they showed zero accountability for it. Shambles. If you include airport travel in your routes, it is supposed to be punctual. And if it isn't, you are supposed to provide reliable customer support. ",5,PT,2024-06-01,Trustpilot

After getting on the bus, everything improved including the bus drive, and the comfort of the drive, and the timeliness, but it was a nightmare getting on the bus, all because of the one uncaring agent.I read the reply to my review, and do not agree that the electronic ticket gives complete information, like which if 10 doors your bus will be at. That is why working monitors in the station are so important. The basis of my complaint is one employee. When I asked him where I would get the Flixbus to Benson, he said to stand at door 10.  I asked him why the monitor had nothing on it, he said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my problem. You will have to talk to IT.‚Äù  I then watched him hassle a man getting on the bus who had a cart of 4 bags.  It took the ticket man to come over and tell this employee that he had paid for the extra bags before he stopped belittling the man. As I found out that was actually my bus, I told him it would have been helpful if he had given me correct info in the first place. That is when he started to profane, tell me I couldn‚Äôt get on the bus, and he was going to call the police. I asked him to go ahead. He tried to get me to exit the bus, but relented when the rest of the passengers supported me and the bus driver wanted to get on his way. I can‚Äôt even accurately say what this person‚Äôs position was, but he did give instructions to the people waiting in line, wore a yellow safety vest, and appeared to scrutinize the persons getting on the bus while the driver checked the tickets.  The negative experience was all related to him, and not the actual bus driver or trip. ",5,DK,2024-05-29,Trustpilot

Safe and affordable,Easy to book good rates but horrible customer service.  I book a bus ticket & missed the trip.  There was some confusion on the bus stop & the time it was leaving. I called to request a ticket for the next bus but was told there is nothing they would do.  No willing to help & expected me to pay almost double the rate since I was purchasing a new ticket last minute.  Save yourself the aggravation & headache.  I ended up contesting the charge with my bank for good or service not received. I did have to pay the higher rate for another ticket & the bus ride took 3 time the posted time to arrive because the bus broke down on the way & a 2 hour 40 mins trip turned into a 8 hour trip to travel 160 miles.  Just a horrible experience all around.  ,4,CZ,2024-05-29,Trustpilot

Pleasant drive,"If it was possible to give a ZERO rating I would. SCAMMERS! This was the worst experience ever! I arrived at the Flix pick up location ( a parking lot without signage, just several Flix buses) a 1/2 hour before we were scheduled to depart, only to discover that the arrival destination on the round trip ticket I had purchased had changed. No one contacted me prior to apprise me or the person I was traveling with of the change. There were also at least two other passengers who were there and discovered the same. Instead of our scheduled arrival to Boston South Station, we were informed by the driver that the furthest he goes is to Cambridge. No one that we spoke to seemed to have any answers other than call customer service. That in itself was a joke. The person who was accompanying me, called twice and spoke to two different ‚Äúcustomer service representatives‚Äù who were no help. One of them even told her that since we opted to ride the bus, our trip had been completed and there was nothing that they could do. We explained that there was no option. We should have been given the courtesy of receiving the information that for whatever reason Flix decided to change their schedule without notifying their passengers BEFORE the bus departed. Had we received the information, we (myself, the person who was accompanying me, and at least 2 other passengers) could have opted to find another mode of transportation instead of being forced to be routed to this location or risk being stuck in New York. To make matters worse, while on the bus, I attempted to contact customer service myself to ask for a supervisor, a corporate email, phone number, or even address so that my concern could be escalated upward. While I was frustrated and angry, I never yelled, was disrespectful, nor used any profanity or foul language but the customer ‚Äúservice‚Äù person hung up the call mid conversation. This was my first time using Flix ( only because the bus company that I normally use was all booked up) and this will be my last. Save yourself time, energy, and frustration, stay away from Flix. I feel like they pulled a bait and switch. They changed our tickets without notifying us or receiving authorization for a change, dropped us off in Cambridge in yet another parking lot (after the scheduled arrival time listed on the original ticket for Boston South station which incidentally caused us to miss our other bus and resulted in us having an added Uber expense). If you must travel from Boston to NY, PLEASE take the Concord Coach. The drivers are professional, the pick up and drop off locations are real, they get you to your destination on time, and their customer service agents are exemplary!FLIXBUS your reply is laughable. Obviously the same person who writes the scripts for the customer ‚Äúservice‚Äù representatives is the same person  who is responsible for responding to customers‚Äô feedback.FLIXBUS this canned response is beyond laughable. Such conflicting statements,‚Äùit is completely unacceptable that you were not informed of the change in arrival prior to your scheduled departure ‚Äú.  ‚Äú We understand your frustration‚Ä¶‚ÄùThen ‚Äúafter carefully checking  we can confirm you have taken the rebooked ride‚Äù and ‚Äúregrettably can‚Äôt issue you a refund‚Äù.The issue was not me taking the ‚Äúrebooked ride‚Äù. The issue is FLIXBUS deciding WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME PRIOR, NOR WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION, to rebook my final arrival destination. The FACTS are:1. I paid in advance for a round trip ticket from Boston South Station to NYC and back to Boston South Station NOT to Cambridge2. You took it upon yourself to change the route WITHOUT notifying anyone 3. I wasn‚Äôt given any advance notice of your arbitrary change in schedule which essentially left me ( and the other 5 passengers who also were expecting to arrive at Boston South Station) with NO CHOICE but to get on the bus or be stranded 200 miles away from where we supposed to be. This is akin to me booking a round trip flight  from Boston to New York, boarding my return flight, doors are closed, and then the pilot announces that it was a nice day and we‚Äôll be landing in New Jersey instead . Sounds ridiculous right?!    4. You regret nothing! You‚Äôve lost nothing. FLIXBUS still received payment, while I, the passenger who was accompanying me, (and at least 3 other passengers) paid FLIXBUS for round trip tickets to a destination that FLIXBUS NEVER took us to. Instead we had to pay additional money in order to get to the destination that we had already paid YOU for!! Then you add insult to injury with a canned patronizing ‚Äúapology‚Äù.

Travel was fast and safe,"I wish I could give ZERO stars. I do NOT recommend Flixbus for coach travel.I boarded a coach from Cardiff to Bristol on 25 April 2024, however unbeknownst to me I was boarded onto the incorrect bus (yes, the driver scanned my ticket and STILL allowed me onto the bus) and I discovered this as we‚Äôre on the motorway and the bus is not stopping at Bristol and headed straight for London. Two other customers also headed for Bristol were scanned onto this bus so the driver either didn‚Äôt care or didn‚Äôt notice/do his job correctly. Either way, he allowed us onto the bus.The drivers changed at Newport so in the new driver‚Äôs defence, he wasn‚Äôt party to the error caused by the driver in Cardiff. After I notified him I needed to get off at Bristol, he diverted to Leigh Delamere services (some 40 minutes away from Bristol) and spoke to his manager, who recommended we get an Uber and submit the expense to Flixbus. The driver did say we could wait for the westbound service coming from London but that was going to take another 2 hours to wait for that service and we all needed to be in work so I forked out some ¬£43 to cover the Uber trip for all of us, believing I would get the refund from Flixbus as promised. Anyway, do you think I‚Äôm getting a refund for this? (Rhetorical question; Flixbus are refusing to issue me a refund saying ‚Äòquite helpfully‚Äô [tongue in cheek] that I should‚Äôve checked the correct bus route‚Ä¶  There was one bus that showed up ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Flixbus also said that the driver wouldn‚Äôt have allowed us onto the wrong bus. If that‚Äôs the case, how did we manage to board the bus‚Ä¶?!)

Muito bom viajar com Flix,"Jeg skulle onsdag 1/5 have v√¶ret med jeres flixbus 620 mod Aarhus. Jeg ankommer p√• Ingerslevsgade i god tid (kl 13.00 ca) og tjekker de busser der holder i forvejen. Ingen af dem, der holder der i forvejen er min bus, s√• jeg venter fortsat og holder √∏je med nyankomne busser. Jeg ender med at st√∏de sammen med 6 andre, der ogs√• skal mod Aarhus som ikke har fundet deres bus ligesom mig. Vi st√•r og venter lidt tid ogs√• kommer der en opdatering, at bussen er forsinket 7 minutter. Alts√• at den f√∏rst vil ankomme/k√∏re 13.27. Vi f√∏lges alle sammen ned til en flixbus der kommer relativt kort tid efter, og sp√∏rger om det er den mod Aarhus, da han ikke har noget nr i ruden. Han siger ‚Äúfinished‚Äù og stiger ind i bussen og lukker d√∏ren. Herfra er vi alle lidt forvirrede og t√¶nker det er underligt, at vores bus ikke er ankommet endnu. Den buschauff√∏r vi lige har snakket med k√∏rer afsted og den tracker vi kan se p√• vores bookede bus passer umiddelbart til hvorn√•r han k√∏rte afsted og hvor han nu befandt sig. S√• vi t√¶nker at vi er blevet snydt, og han ligesom er k√∏rt uden os. Vi ringer derfor til kundeservice (stadig de 6 mennesker), og ham vi fik fat p√• forklarede at han ikke kunne g√∏re noget, men at bussen var k√∏rt og der var passagere p√•. S√• det var vores eget problem. Det virker bare underligt, at 6 af os √•benbart har misset den selvom vi har st√•et forskellige steder (inden den blev forsinket) + at den tracker der passede til vores bus ogs√• passede p√• ham der afviste os.

VERGONZOSO.,"I purchased a ticket from the Greyhound Bus website, but my ride was contracted out to Flix Bus. The first driver that I encountered was rude and unprofessional. To add insult to injury, we were dropped off at a vacant lot leased/owned by Flix Bus, in the middle of Downtown Houston. We had no where to sit, no covering, no building, and no bathrooms. I had to walk a few blocks up the road to a gas station, just to use the bathroom. I had to stand up in that vacant lot for 3 1/2 hours until the next bus arrived to bring me to my final destination. I had no idea that I would be dropped off at a vacant lot, with no facilities. I think that Flix needs to be extremely transparent about what the customers should expect throughout their trip. Tell them that they will be dropped off in unsafe neighborhoods, and that they will not have a building or station to go into. Tell them that they may get dropped off in front of abandoned buildings, and that they may have to walk a mile or two to get to a bathroom. Tell them that they may be outside for several hours depending on how long the layover is. This was an absolutely horrible experience. Beyond horrible.",1,GB,2024-05-26,Trustpilot

Pick up and drop off locations were in the absolute nastiest part of both towns.

Edit: As you can see by the below response, they could care less about a driver belittling a customer. Claiming it is a ‚Äòone off‚Äô.  I paid $6 extra to pick the front seat and the driver said no one is EVER allowed to sit in the front (therefore DOUBTFUL my experience was a ‚Äòone off‚Äô) and as a matter of fact he said I shouldn‚Äôt ask for a refund of it because it makes up for me being LATE. I was on the bus 5 min before departure.

Fahrt von Freiburg nach Neapel,Due to train strikes I booked a flix bus from manchester to liverpool at 23:40. The tracking suggested the bus left at 23:15 but on the tracker also showed the gps was around the corner - very confusing. We found the bus around the corner from the bus station with ‚Äòout of service‚Äô and no one to be seen. After ringing at 00:40 requesting a refund as at this point we had been kicked out the bus station and I had booked a national express for 1am as it was the last chance to get back. On the phone was told the terms and conditions said I wasn‚Äôt entitled for one unless it was more than 2hrs and then they‚Äôd pay a bus or train. Didn‚Äôt want to take that risk as there are no buses or trains after 1am until 5am! After my call (I was the second to report as there was a large group) I understand it did get sorted but we were not to know this and are out of pocket for getting a national express which showed up on time. ,4,US,2024-05-25,Trustpilot

The service was brilliant, seats were more comfortable than other coaches, I can't comment on the toilet as I didn't use it. The bus times were bang on as well, not a minute early or late. My only complaint is a small one, the coach stopped for 5 minutes whilst one of the drivers went in to a petrol station to grab themselves a drink, absolutely not a problem in the slightest with that but they could have let passengers off as well for 5 minutes to stretch their legs too especially since this service runs all the way down to London Victoria.

BOOK FLIX BUS AT YOUR OWN RISK,What a mess. The bus stop for St. Catharines to Toronto is not at the bus station but nearby at some random intersection which I did not know about and missed the bus.

I just made my Flix connection in Toronto to Belleville only because the bus driver saw me banging on the station window and waving as she was pulling out and kindly stopped and let me on. I want a refund for the St. Catharines Toronto portion of the trip at the very least. Tried to contact Flix but no response so far. Also once in Belleville the bus drops you at the Burger King parking lot not the bus station where my elderly mum was waiting to pick me up. What a mess.

FlixBus Lost and Found email ,"Montr√©al to NYC (23h45 - 7h50) - FLIXBUS (Greyhound bus)- Bus was 45 minutes late.

Driver did not care at all and was nonchalant.- Space very cramped, way too small for a 7 hours trip.- Condition of bus was subpar.I contacted the customer service for a refund after the trip. They refunded less than 5$/person for the ""payed seats"" that were broken, which does not adequately compensate for the discomfort and inconvenience we experienced throughout the journey.It was a REALLY bad exprience.

On time and very few stops,"Had a bus booked from Scotland to England with Flixbus, around 24 hours before departure flixbus charged my card ¬£40.98 and issued me another 2 tickets for the exact same bus I was already due to be on.... No idea why!Contacted their customer service and spoke to the most rude and unprofessional person I've ever come across in my life. The exact words he used throughout the conversation was 'but you still had tickets so what's the problem haha' well the problem is I was only ¬£20 for the first set of tickets and I was then charged a further ¬£40.98! In addition to this he then said 'all you British people are the same' I thought these sort of things had stopped in modern day Germany? Nothing but racism and they just don't care, tell you to fill in a form and they will never give you a resolution, instead they will ask silly questions which are irrelevant to the situation. Clearly a company of desperate thieves. But not to worry the transaction in question has now been sent to the Visa chargeback scheme! Avoid this company unless you want a rubbish service with a bus that collects you in the middle of the street not even at a bus stop, even the driver said people are double charged all the time and they do nothing about it in Germany.

I come from Europe where the service on Flix is reasonable and booked an overnight bus from New Orleans to Atlanta, after 3 hours we stopped in Mobil, Alabama to switch drivers except the new driver didn't show up. Instead of organizing a replacement the information counter (after telling us they didn't know what was going on for 2 hours) told us we needed to book ourselves onto the next bus. Only when  I called Flix they said that Greyhound (who they own) hadn't reported the problem yet so I couldn't rebook. I spent 12 hours in the bus stop - it was dangerous and full of homeless people.

No one from Flix was present at either location to answer questions - adding to confusion and worry.  The bus arrived late, and the driver could not say where it was possible to find a taxi at arrival... when he had just driven us past the rail station minutes before. When the people seated in the row ahead of you decide to recline their seats fully, beware - no room!  An unscheduled stop required a change of bus, and the announcement - only in Italian - left many wondering what was required.  If the weather had been poor, this would have been an even worse experience.  I would rate this a minus one (-1); never to be repeated.  IJC",5,ES,2024-05-21,Trustpilot

It completely disrupted my peace on the ride 2) the driver repeatedly using their phone while driving 3) the buses they put you in aren‚Äôt always flux bus branding therefore they find it okay to try to make you sit in different seats even if you paid for a specific seat in the front or no neighbor.

Don‚Äôt do it! Worst company I‚Äôve ever been scammed by,"Flixbuss er helt forferdelig. Vi var 7 jenter som skulle ta bussen fra Sarpsborg til Oslo som ble nektet adgang p√• bussen.

Vi gjorde dette og viste sj√•f√∏ren at vi hadde billett og at dette var v√•r buss, men han insisterte at vi tok feil og at vi m√•tte forlate bussen. S√• vi hadde ikke noe annet valg enn √• g√• av bussen. Vi ringte kundeservice for √• f√• hjelp, men de nektet √• hjelpe oss. Dette f√∏rte til at alle m√•tte bruke 500kr ekstra hver for √• komme oss hjem, i tillegg til at vi mistet toget vi skulle rekke i Oslo. Vi sendte en klage og ba om refusjon p√• billetten vi hadde kj√∏pt, men ble nektet ogs√• dette. Jeg kan ikke beskrive hvor mye jeg frar√•der alle √• velge flixbuss i fremtiden.

Time frame to complete transaction ,"Absolutely the WORST PART during my whole approximate 10-day stay in Portugal. Booked two buses for my trips in and out Lisbon, and met rude and indifferent drivers for both of the rides. Seems like none of the drivers at their company have the basic capability to at least say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù  or ‚ÄúBye‚Äù to their customers, or give a basic helping hand for luggages. The first driver was on her phone speaking at a 100db voice for at least 1.5hr. The second driver just spoke one sentence to me ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt eat on my bus‚Äù at the very first second, whilst I was NEITHER holding any food on my hands, NOR i look like a gluttonous pig or something. For the second ride, I paid extra money for the most front row seat in order to get some personal space. And the madame next to me just could not stop talking loudly on her phone for 3 hours straight, and rudely sticking her FAT leg (not exaggerating) into my space from the very first second. I gave her a gaze, trying not to arouse any possible disputes, and she started to spit out a string of Portuguese to me, and still refused to move an inch of her fat leg, so i have to lean myself into the aisle for the whole 3.5hr trip. Though i couldn‚Äôt understand a single word she was saying,  but i could tell it was definitely something impolite, and somehow RACISM. And a bunch of passengers were playing videos or tiktoks out loud in the whole bus, so the whole space was incredibly noisy and unbearable,  more like a marketplace. When i got off the bus, I never felt such a strong salvation and relief in my life.üòáMy whole journey in Europe and in Portugal had been great and have met loads of nice people along the way, until I rode this HELL of a ride on Flixbus. However, i still wanna believe in that most of Portuguese people are friendly, well-behaved, and are NOT racists. Thanks to Flixbus, whom left an indelible STAIN in my memory of Portugal. Will Never Ever ride a Flixbus again in my life time, and will definitely try my best to STOP any friends or family members from booking a Flixbus. People come for vacays, which should be comfortable and stress-less, and absolute NO ONE should deserve this kind of treatment.",4,HR,2024-05-16,Trustpilot

√ßok uzun gecikme ile ilgili hi√ß bir‚Ä¶,"Bonjour,√† cause de l'√©boulement alpin ayant conduit √† l'impossibilit√© d'utiliser la voie ferroviaire, nous nous sommes repli√©s, avec quelque anxi√©t√© au vu de la r√©putation tr√®s al√©atoire de la compagnie, sur la solution Flixbus pour notre voyage en Italie pr√©vu du 14 au 21 avril 2024 (aller-retour Lyon/Turin avec correspondance TGV italien vers Milan) du dimanche au dimanche). Au moins, les prix sont modiques : 27,99 euros / personne et par trajet.1¬∞ Cela a en effet bien mal commenc√©, puisque d√®s le jeudi 11/04, nous recevons un mail nous indiquant, sans avancer aucune raison, que notre Flixbus de retour de 17H55 arrivant √† Lyon √† 22h15 (3146356476 ou 3051958010) est annul√©!! La mort dans l'√¢me, je suis les instructions ""g√©rer ma r√©servation"" pour ""trouver des alternatives possibles"", et la seule solution qu'on me propose (car nous avions un RDV le lundi 22/04) est le bus suivant de 0h30, arriv√©e √† 4h50 √† Lyon (sic). Je clique sur la r√©sa, t√©l√©charge mon billet et me dis que bon, c'est la faute √† pas de chance, que c'est du low cost...Dont acte.2¬∞ L'aller Lyon-Turin, dans un bus pas tr√®s confortable, se passe assez correctement pour le prix, bien que le chauffeur soit sur son portable, y compris dans les virages et les descentes - ill√©gal et tr√®s dangereux. 3¬∞ En revanche, le retour fut horrible : quand √† l'heure o√π, d'habitude je suis dans les bras de Morph√©e (0h30!), je pr√©sente mon portable au chauffeur (qui ne parlait qu'italien), il nous HURLE litt√©ralement dessus que nous ne pouvons pas monter! Je demande pourquoi, et, lorsqu'il pointe avec hostilit√© son doigt sur mon t√©l√©phone, je ne peux que constater avec effroi que la date de r√©servation n'avait pas √©t√© modifi√©e automatiquement quand j'avais cliqu√© sur l'alternative propos√©e en suivant les consignes de la plateforme (3153984377) Donc nos billets √©taient de la veille 21/04 et pas 22/04 !! Quel tour de passe passe honteux et malhonn√™te, un vrai scandale! R√©sultat : pris en otage en pleine nuit et sous la pluie, nous n'avons eu d'autre choix que de prendre √† la h√¢te de nouveaux billets (3156371762) √†, cerise sur le g√¢teau, un prix exorbitant : 134,99 euros par personne pour le seul retour, en tout 162,98 euros pour se faire insulter et voyager dans des conditions affreuses !! => JAMAIS PLUS je ne prendrai de Flixbus, donc je ne veux pas de bons d'achats mais un remboursement total, partout je raconterai cette horrible exp√©rience, et je m'en vais m'adresser √† une association de consommateurs pour un recours.

Just very convenient when other‚Ä¶,"I recently had the misfortune of using FlixBus for a trip, and it was nothing short of a disaster. From start to finish, the experience was a nightmare. Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôll never use FlixBus again:Delays, Delays, Delays: FlixBus seems to have a knack for arriving late. My bus was delayed not just by a few minutes, but by a whopping two hours! No explanations, no apologies, just a lot of frustrated passengers waiting around in confusion.Uncomfortable Seats: The seats on FlixBus are like torture devices. They're cramped, uncomfortable, and lacking any semblance of cushioning. Trying to endure a long journey in these seats felt like punishment.Filthy Conditions: It‚Äôs as if FlixBus has never heard of cleaning. The bus I rode in was disgustingly dirty. There were food crumbs on the seats, sticky spills on the floor, and a foul odor that lingered throughout the entire journey. It felt like I was traveling in a dumpster on wheels.Toilet Not Working: Adding insult to injury, the toilet on the bus was out of order. Imagine being stuck on a bus for hours with no functioning restroom! It's not only inconvenient but also unsanitary and unacceptable.Terrible Customer Service: When I tried to reach out to customer service about the delay, I was met with indifference and incompetence. The representatives were rude and unhelpful, offering no solutions or compensation for the inconvenience caused.Unreliable Wi-Fi: FlixBus advertises Wi-Fi onboard, but good luck actually using it. The connection was slow and spotty at best, making it impossible to get any work done or even browse the internet.Overcrowding: FlixBus doesn‚Äôt seem to care about passenger comfort or safety. The bus was packed beyond capacity, with people standing in the aisles and blocking emergency exits. It was a safety hazard waiting to happen.Hidden Fees: Don‚Äôt be fooled by the cheap ticket prices advertised by FlixBus. Once you factor in all the hidden fees for things like luggage or choosing a specific seat, the cost quickly adds up. It‚Äôs a classic bait-and-switch tactic.In conclusion, save yourself the headache and avoid FlixBus at all costs. The cheap ticket prices aren‚Äôt worth the stress and discomfort you‚Äôll endure. I‚Äôd rather walk than ride with FlixBus again.",5,SE,2024-05-13,Trustpilot

Viaggio molto rilassante.,"Do not ever book with Flixbus, they will scam you. My mother and I had a bus for 10:30AM from Tilburg to Rotterdam today and I was sent an email and text notifying me of a 53 min delay with a new departure time of 11:34. We waited in the cold and the bus never showed, and after waiting more past 11:34, I checked on the app and it showed the bus on route. I have no idea what happened to the bus and I messaged customer service but they will not give me a refund because the bus‚Äôs scheduled time to leave had passed and the delay was not more than two hours. I feel completely scammed and like I wasted my time, I don‚Äôt know if they just skipped the stop or not, the bus did not come and we waited for nothing. I will never book with flixbus again. I had used their service before and they always have issues with delays but this experience was so bad, I can never trust them again. I am warning all my friends and family to not rrust this company.

It was easy to choose,"I went on a trip from London to Vienna and it was an absolute nightmare. For context, I am a 20-year-old female student, and I was solo travelling with a transfer on both the outbound and return journey. My outbound journey was to stop at Cologne, and was delayed for 3 hours at departure. I was to miss my transfer in Cologne, and no attempt was made to contact me in regards to booking me onto the next available bus, as stated on the help page. I ended up having to look for my own alternate form of transport, which was significantly more expensive than my originally planned ticket, and was stranded overnight in Cologne with no food or water. Mind you, I was later made aware that I was not to receive compensation for my delayed journey as I decided to take it anyway, and rather than refunding my more expensive alternative bus to Vienna, my original ticket was to be refunded, which was appalling enough as is.I thought the nightmare was over, but my journey back proved to be significantly worse. Once again, my bus was delayed, and I was going to miss my transfer, this time in Belgium. Once again, I had to book my own alternative transport, as no attempt was made by Flixbus to rectify their own mistakes. This time, however, I was stranded overnight for a whole 12 hours, and had to organise accommodation myself. I would like to remind you that I am a female student and felt incredibly unsafe and abandoned in an unfamiliar city, and was lucky enough to even find room in a hostel that I had the funds for. My subsequent transfer suffered only a minor delay at departure, but missed the ferry, due to which we were stuck at the port for ages - once again, no opportunity to get food or water, absolutely boiling in the bus. While I did manage to get home (fast-forward 48 hours, for both journeys), it was already nighttime by the time I arrived, so once again I was left incredibly vulnerable.I feel the only fitting description of my experience with Flixbus is Murphy's Law: 'Anything that can go wrong will go wrong'. I am shocked at just how uncooperative the company was, and even at the state of the delays of the buses, and I can safely say I will never be taking ANY journeys with Flixbus again.

Great  service with fare prices,"Flixbus driver left my friend and me in highway, on gas station close to Portogruaro (indicated stopping time was 40-60 minutes, we went to toilet for 10 minutes , and bus was gone, driver knew we are going to toilet, we asked him if we have time to go, and he confirmed). Flixbus customer service refused to tell us where is our luggage, but by detective work we found it it's probably in Torino, end station of the route. We went to Torino (which was not in our plan, so that's means additional costs), we found our luggage in Flixbus luggage office, and all valuable items were stolen, including two laptops. Whoever did it had time to pedantically inspect backpacks and chose items to steal (for example, only some clothes was stolen, only perfume from cosmetic bag , they opened every pocket and every plastic bag, our luggage was in a mess), which means it must have been done in collaboration with Flixbus official. If it was a street thief, he would just grab the whole backpacks and run. The perpetrator did his selective stealing in peace, with precision. Another interesting fact: driver was counting passengers on every station before Portogruaro. It's very unusual that , firstly, he lied to us about stopping time, secondly, he didn't realize we are not back in the bus.",5,GB,2024-05-06,Trustpilot
The drive was with a safe and courteous‚Ä¶,"Trip from London to Amsterdam went smooth. It's a long trip so I would advise to take the 3 pm departure.

Except for 1 person getting detained (you need your papers to be in order). The ferry to Calais takes 90 minutes and we got a meal voucher, which I was very happy with. I will use Flixbus again to different locations. Tip: depending on how old the bus is, u do get a European socket to charge your phone (so take your adapter with you on the bus), or a usb-c port.

Great experience!,"DO NOT USE THIS LYING SCAM COMPANY! this was quite honestly the worst experience i‚Äôve ever had with a company EVER IN MY LIFE!we booked for an 8:30am bus from LA to palm springs for coachella. arrived half an hour early and saw our bus was delayed til 10:44am. we then wait and see 10 mins before the new arrival time it is now delayed until 11:30am. THEN DELAYED UNTIL 12:10pm. bare in my mind they are not once letting us know this, it is just on a TV screen that will update the time. when speaking with staff about what‚Äôs going on, asking questions why, and expressing concerns and anxiety over what to do (i‚Äôm an australian tourist so had no idea what else to do), we were met with a passive aggressive, rude and snarky old man who gave no explanation or help - and actually shooed me away to sit down because he didn‚Äôt want to answer my questions anymore. eventually we had to book a $180 USD ($250+ AUD) uber down to palm springs as we were now 4+ hours delayed. other buses they had as well were just being delayed or cancelled also. this location was also so dodgy and scary and made us feel extremely overwhelmed and anxious. a horrible way to start our coachella weekend. fast forward to monday and we have another bus booked with them that was supposed to bring us from palm springs back up to LA. we booked the 1:45pm bus that would get us to downtown LA at 4:15pm. we had a dinner reservation at 5:30 with a family friend before our flight home that evening. the bus was DELAYED AGAIN and did not show up until 3pm. we also all had to sit outside in the boiling desert sun this whole time as they didn‚Äôt have enough seats inside. extremely dodgy location. when asking the workers what‚Äôs going on we were told they had no details on flixbus as it‚Äôs not their company, flixbus buses just drop and pickup there. we then called the customer hotline to seek help as we had no emails or texts telling us what‚Äôs going on. when we finally got through, the flixbus hotline told us they had NO ANSWERS, and that we should email. we expressed that we needed answers now and an email wouldn‚Äôt help. the lady couldn‚Äôt answer and genuinely did not help with anything. she just told us the bus might or might not arrive. eventually at 3pm the bus arrives, at this point we are all burnt and just want to go home. our seats we selected were just sat by other people and we were told people just ‚Äúsit wherever they like‚Äù. we finally left this dodgy location and instead of taking us to downtown LA, they start driving around palm springs for another hour or so picking up other people. so now it‚Äôs around 4:30 and we still haven‚Äôt left palm springs yet. we end up getting back to downtown LA at 7pm‚Ä¶ we have now missed our dinner reservation, have no time to see our relative that we haven‚Äôt seen in years, and we now have to rush to the airport. finally, we got an email the next day saying ‚Äúsorry you were delayed, here‚Äôs 10% off your next order‚Äù‚Ä¶ what a joke. honestly please please please DO NOT USE FLIXBUS!!! i beg of you. this is one of the worst companies i‚Äôve ever experienced in my life. they are so poorly organised, dodgy and rude - and the lack of information and communication is atrocious. i cannot stress enough SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME! everybody there was so appalled, upset or angry, and we all vowed to never use this disgusting company. it was hands down the worst part of my trip and almost ruined our trip as we were so anxious and worried, and felt like we were stuck in a country we don‚Äôt know with no other alternative transport. awful awful awful do not use this disgusting scam of a company!

Horrid Bathroom,"For the last few years, the quality of Flixbus has dropped a lot, speaking about buses circulating in Spain, Portugal & South of France. There is extreme dirtiness and an unpleasant smell in the salon, the backrests of the seats and plugs are broken so in case the bus is full, your several hour travel becomes a nightmare. Finally, nearly in 100% of the cases drivers lock WC so if you miss the latest stop, you pass several hours without being able to visit a restroom. On top of that, last time the driver even didn't have a key from one of the trunks, so I needed to crawl inside a dirty storage location as my bag appeared to be next to the opposite door, which he could not open.I still give priority to bus transportation for Environmental Reasons, but lately, if there is an alternative company on the route, I give preference to them.

Bus departed on time,"Hola, recientemente he tenido un problema con Flixbus en EEUU. La direcci√≥n de salida del bus que pon√≠a en el billete, comprado con much√≠sima antelaci√≥n, no era correcta, por lo cual, al estar esperando en el sitio incorrecto que Flixbus hab√≠a indicado, perdimos dicho bus. Al contactar con ellos en ese preciso momento,se lavaron las manos y nos vimos obligadas a comprar un segundo billete mucho m√°s caro y que no nos llevaba hasta nuestro destino final, por lo que adem√°s tuvimos que pagar un trayecto de taxi adicional. Tras reclamar en multitud de ocasiones, se enrocan en su pol√≠tica inflexible de t√©rminos y condiciones generales y se quedan tan panchos. Continuar√© peleando para que nos indemnicen con los gastos adicionales que su grave descuido y su posterior inoperancia nos causaron. Actualizaci√≥n 10 de Junio 2024: tras la contestaci√≥n de Flixbus reitero que la informaci√≥n del billete era incorrecta sobre d√≥nde abordar el bus. Eso nos caus√≥ un gran perjuicio. Ustedes no asumieron su responsabilidad en proporcionar correctamente la informaci√≥n en los billetes que emiten y fuimos nosotras las que asumimos su error con un gasto extra del qur siguen sin hacerse cargo.

Very good,"For anyone who intends to book trip with Flixbus: Please don‚Äôt be fooled by their good advertisement on internet. They‚Äôre like a scam service. My experience with them was the worst in my life, like a nightmare. The Flixbus doesn‚Äôt have much buses as they advertise, they hire multiple operator companies that have buses and they just gather you online to assign to those operator companies. Because of that they have no quality control over those operators and cannot support you anything related to your trip. My experience: I took the bus from LA to Vegas. The staff at Flixbus LA departure was professional and supportive. However, the bus and the driver are from a different company, not Flixbus. And therefore, they have no quality control. There were two stops on the way from LA to Vegas, the driver did not clearly communicate about the departure from those stops. Then once I got out of the shop at the stop, they started moving the car from the parking lot already. I still could see the bus and thus I ran after, knocked on the bus but the driver ignored me and drove away although the car was still in the parking lot and it was obvious enough for the driver to see me from the mirror but he ignored. And my nightmare starts when I realised all of my luggages were at that bus. I quickly called Flixbus customer support services but they‚Äôre just time waster and kept telling me the only way to get back my luggage is to log a form and they‚Äôll get back within 14 DAYS!! Even though I know exactly where the bus will be and what time, they just don‚Äôt help contacting that bus to let me take my luggage, they just ask to fill an useless form which no one looks at. Luckily I figured out to contact the operator company and was lucky enough to get back my luggages. But Flixbus would not let their customers know such a simple conduct is really unethical. When I arrived at the operator company office, I saw bunches of lost luggages sitting there for months. How many people got in trouble with Flixbus?! I would wish everyone read this comment and choose other operators if possible otherwise you‚Äôll also know how to deal with the situations. *Update: after my truthful comment, the FLIXBUS even has the audacity to flagged my comment as fake review. And of course I proved with the TrustPilot site with evidence and got verified. It‚Äôs just unbelievable with how unethical the FLIXBUS could be. I just tell the truth about them and I will never stop doing so. Such an unethical company. ",5,BR,2024-05-03,Trustpilot

Booking was easy and intuitive,"HORRIBLE HORRIBL HORRIBLETHERE IS A REASON THAT FLIXBUS REVIEWS in the UNITED STATES  ARE..... ""NOT GOOD""There are two parts to this ""MUST READ REVIEW""The first part is my original reviewThe second part is FLIXBUS CUSTOMER SERVICE....who flagged my review because they do not believe it is a"" GENUINE REVIEW"" and said they needed "" more information."" This addition will show  readers how really horrible the customer service is:   SEE  SCREEN SHOT BELOW WITH A COPY OF MY TICKETYou will want to read to the end  of my review to understand the horrible drivers they hire ....and the  disrespect and distain  they have for their customers who take Flixbus. It appears that FLIXBUS, from my round trip ticket, does not hire Americans who speak English...either drivers or customer service counter  employees. You will note on the attached ticket there are many other ""SUB COINTRACTOR"" BUS COMPANIES they useI will explain.I took a round trip from Hartford to Boston..booking no. 315 033 3226 ......attached below clearly shows the destination to and from along with the seats numberThe person at the FLIXBUS counter was disrespectful, unhelpful and spoke little English.The Bus driver was Chinese... unpleasant, dismissive and abrupt.I lived in China for 20 years. and am very aware of  their negative  attitude toward Americans.I spoke to him in Mandarin....hoping to make him smile. He did not even look up ....or acknowledge  me.On my return trip I was one hour early. There was another bus going to Hartford...only partially full.I asked the Chinese driver if he would be kind enough to allow me to take this bus.NO.... I was told.OK.... I understand rues and regulations.My bus arrived on time ....with still another Chinese Driver...just as unpleasant as the  outgoing trip.When the bus was  ready to leave, the driver sat in the station with his door closed.All the passengers noticed a group of  6 high school girls waving at the gate door and rushing towards the bus.They stood at the bus door. The driver clearly saw them...and as they tried to get him to open the door...he started the bus and left them stranded., I looked at my watch. There were 21 seconds left to the departure time. I was enraged the entire ride home......angry at myself for not calling out the driver out.The driver is paid to serve the customers. A good driver would have immediately opened the door...especially since they could be anyone's children or grandchildren waiting to meet their families at their destination.We arrived in Hartford 10 minutes early....enough time to have let these children onto the bus.Either  upper management does not supervise their drivers or they do not hold them accountable for their bad  behaviorI am 74. I no longer allow injustice and BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE... to go unacknowledged.I go to as many sites  as possible..to place my review...hoping that other people will find alternative transportation services where they can be treated with respect and dignity.FYIFlixbus is a German Company. I sent a review to the executive team in Germany.......In Europe public transportation is excellent because it is how the average person travels because it is so inexpensive.If the owners were aware of the bad drivers being hired in the US, the drivers should be fired immediately.That would be my suggestion PART TWOAs you can see in my original review, I provided my booking no: Hartford to Boston..booking no. 315 033 3226It includes the time, dates and  seat number for both going and returning trips.See Screen shotsAll this info is in their data base, easily visible to them. They claimed to TRUSTPILOT that  they needed this information....which they haveFrom the Flixbus logs... they can trace the names of the drives, arrival and departure times.... as well as the ACTUAL NUMBER OF PASSENGERS WHO WERE ON EACH BUS TRIPMY  complaint of not allowing the  team of young girls on the bus will be be reflected in their own records. They intentionally  flagged my account too make it more difficult for me in order too remove my  review Flix bus service is HORRIBLE.,,.,.and this is another perfect example they have little respect for their customersLINK TO SCREEN SHOT OF TICKETS/BOOKING/Users/louisnichole/Desktop/Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 6.55.08‚ÄØPM.png",5,NZ,2024-05-02,Trustpilot
Amazing experience,"Porto - Lisboa, 18h30, domingo, 14-04-2024O motorista era no m√≠nimo imprudente.

Quando o √∫ltimo passageiro chegou, arrancou a toda a velocidade, quase n√£o dando tempo para a pessoa subir para o corredor, quanto mais para se sentar, acabando por tombar em cima de outros passageiros, felizmente sem problemas para ningu√©m. A parte final da viagem foi em sistema de contrarrel√≥gio, passando variadas vezes pela faixa mais √° esquerda da autoestrada, a dita terceira faixa. No dia anterior, a viagem de ida √†s 8h correu muito bem, com 10 minutos de paragem a meio do percurso, comunicados em bom som pelo sistema de som do autocarro, e embora andasse r√°pido, o motorista n√£o fez da estrada uma pista de velocidade.",5,HU,2024-05-02,Trustpilot

Ik maakte een retour parijs-sloterdijk, beide keren bussen op tijd vertrokken, zelfs iets eerder dus wees op tijd, ook omdat die haltes zowel in amsterdam als in parijs echt verstopt zitten. naar parijs reed ik op vrijdag, die bus kwam vast te zitten in de spits en was ruim 1,5 uur vertraagd, kan flixbus verder niets aan doen maar je moet zelf bepalen of je dat de moeite waard vindt of toch liever wat sneller reist, ik zou dit niet nog eens doen. Terug op zondagavond was helemaal prima, geen spits, halfuurtje eerder thuis dan gepland. heen was een luxe bus met oplaadpunten en wc, terug was een matige bus zonder oplaadpunten en wc. boek een panoramaplek zou ik zeggen, dan zit je wat lekkerder, en neem een powerbank en snacks mee, en zakdoekjes oid voor de wc want dat papier was op.

The bus never showed up‚Ä¶,"FlixBus was extremely unorganized and unprofessional. On our first trip, the bus was involved in a crash. The driver did not tell us what was going to happen, or anything, and continued driving with a smashed window. With a two-hour delay, the bus driver gave no explanation and did NOT care about passengers missing their next connection.My return trip from Erlangen to Paris was again quite eventful. I think the drivers experience fatigue (often the driver got lost---we had circled around in many different cities for 2 times, sometimes even 3 times!) and are overwhelmed (Required to manage the tickets, luggage and drive at the same time for long-distances). Overall, I wouldn't recommend FlixBus, and I will not be using them in my travel plans any time soon. ",1,GB,2024-04-25,Trustpilot

Unfreundliche und inkompetente Personen, die kaum Deutsch sprechen k√∂nnen und keine Handhabe haben, einem weiter zu helfen. An die richtige Abteilung weitergeleitet zu werden, kann man vergessen. Wenn man ein Problem hat, kommt die standartantwort: ‚Äûtut mir leid, wir k√∂nnen nichts machen‚Äú.

Einfache Aussagen dar√ºber, welches Partnerunternehmen die Fahrt durchgef√ºhrt hat oder wo die Taschen abgegeben werden nach einer Fahrt, werden mir nicht beantwortet. Entweder, der Busfahrer hat meine Tasche geklaut (wovon ich nicht ausgehe) oder er hat sie irgendwo abgegeben, aber FlixBus macht keine Anstalten, mir bei der Suche auch nur irgendwie zu helfen. Ich gehe davon aus, dass die Tasche einfach weggeschmissen wurde - so geht die Firma FlixBus mit seinen Angestellten und Kunden um. UNTERST√úTZT DIESES UNTERNEHMEN NICHT!

It doesn't explain where the bus‚Ä¶,"I arrived for the bus, was told it would be a one hour delay. Was never updated again. Bus did not arrive for 2 and a half hours. 20 minutes into the trip, the bus driver pulled over because she thought her headlights were out and was on the phone with someone trying to figure out how to get them turned on, to no avail. After 15 minutes of trying, she stepped off the bus and came back on saying they were on the whole time. Once we got into NYC she was no longer able to navigate herself and drive the bus. 2 passengers had to stand in the aisle right behind the driver for the last hour of my trip directing her where to go, though the passengers were not familiar with the routes that are bus-specific and we wound up going down several side streets that clearly were not suitable for a vehicle as large as a bus. The driver had to go into reverse gear multiple times, one of which was on an exit ramp off the highway. On the highway she rear-ended a car and then refused to properly acknowledge the man when he asked who was going to pay for the damage to his car (I have video of the interaction). At this point we were an hour past the time it was supposed to take to get us to Newark. One passenger asked to get off the bus so he could take an Uber and she refused to let him off. She could not located where to take the bus even when she did arrive near the stations. In the process of trying to find the George Washington Bridge stop, she slammed on the brakes sending us all lurching forward only because multiple people screamed to warn her that she was inches away from hitting an elderly woman on a cane in a crosswalk. Another woman attempted to get off the bus to take an Uber and the driver again refused to let her off the bus. This was when multiple of we passengers began protesting and the driver finally pulled over to let many of us off the bus. Though we were not at our final destination we had no choice because a.) we did not feel at all safe on this bus any longer and b.) we were beginning to think we would miss our event if we stayed on any longer. We had to take a $100 Uber from GW Bridge to Newark, wasted the entirety of our booking in an Air B&B as we were supposed to arrive at 1:55pm and did not arrive until after 6pm. Given all of this, and particularly that we did not receive the entirety of the service we paid for because we did not reach our destination via your bus, we request at the very least, a refund of our 3 tickets.

There was nothing with that address on it and nothing that said Fluxbus anywhere in the area.  They need to do a better job at identifying their bus stops!I tried to contact Flixbus but there was no phone number and the chat did nothing.   Getting desperate, we went to the bus stop at the airport and the greyhound bus driver told us that was the stop.  You need to provide clear instructions on where to catch the southbound bus. And then screwed on the refund for the return bus.  They didn‚Äôt actually refund anything.  They gave me a $30 credit for 6 tickets plus the cost to choose seats. I won‚Äôt ever use flixbus again so what good does a tiny fraction credit do me?   ",5,NL,2024-04-25,Trustpilot

The same went for my wife.We could no even lift the foot rest from its resting position before the seat in front prevented further movement of our legs.I noticed that other passengers, who were slightly taller, had to sit sideways in order to achieve a somewhat more comfortable ride.The journey home using the National Express service was very much more acceptable.

I am due a refund,"Most importantly, FlixBus was a safe means of transportation, and I was more than happy not to drive from San Francisco to Sacramento and back. The drivers were courteous and clear in their announcements. The emailed updates from FlixBus were helpful. BUT: Overhead reading lights did not turn on (but they came on when the bus stopped at access points.) My outlet didn't work. The restroom on the return trip was a mess (goodness only knows how the door lock works, and the remnants of a roll of toilet paper were lying on a shelf. No way to wash hands; luckily I travel with sprays and wipes.) On the plus side, there was a VERY NECESSARY grab bar. Also, I had assigned seats but the drivers announced it was open seating (I would have been more annoyed if I'd paid for two seats to myself, which I certainly would consider if that option was available in future. My seat mate was fine, until he started loudly talking to a friend on the phone about all the great weed and beer he had with him. And his earbuds were in at the first stop, which was mine. I had to ask him several times to please move so I could exit my seat.)The bus stop in San Francisco is still marked ""Megabus,"" so people weren't sure if they were in the right place. There is no seating and it's right at a bike and scooter path. I warned people to move off the green path; it's potentially a dangerous situation. The stop in Sacramento didn't have a specific FlixBus sign either, but it did have some seating. I will say people waiting there were friendly, and they assured newcomers that yes, it was the right place to wait for the bus.",1,ME,2024-04-25,Trustpilot

First and last time booking with‚Ä¶,"At boarding we were not allowed to take even small backpack on board and had to be stowed. As the backpack contained articles required during trip it had to be emptied and contents transferred to a cloth bag to take on board.Seats 3D, 3C had been purchased through payment for reserved seats. After boarding we were denied our seats and had to settle for a seat at the back that had still not been occupied by unreserved passengers.The seats were uncomfortable and there were no power sockets for charging phones etc.Also no wifi service. The seats were narrow and the socket for safety belt was raised above seat level and was poking my side all through journey. Cushioning for seat and headrest was too firm for comfort. After I sat down in seat 10D I realised something was sticky. To my horror I found chewing gum on seat which got stuck to my pants. It was a very traumatic experience for me as I felt filthy with no chance to change into clean clothes till reaching home in Houston. So I had to suffer like this for 8 hours as the bus itself reached one hour after scheduled time.The toilet was unusable and dirty since there was no water. We were only allowed a very short time in Lake Charles for restroom break after having travelled for over 4 hours on the bus. We were not allowed to use restrooms at stoppages in Baton Rouge and Lafayette and had to wait till Lake Charles.All in all it was a miserable experience, especially with the chewing gum sticking to my pants and the unusable toilet on board.

Everything,"Went from Lisbon to Porto by FlixBus. There was not a single working electric plug in the whole bus. I asked the lady driver to put my powerbank to charge at her place as only she had the working USB outlet. She agreed. Unfortunately I forgot to take it when I took off the bus. I remembered about it and returned to the station in 45 minutes, but the bus was already gone. I asked another driver at the station to contact the driver of my bus, and she confirmed that she had my powerbank and cable with her and would return to Campanha at 17:00. I was waiting there since 17:00 till 18:00, but she didn't return. I left a claim at Lost&Found, describing the situation in every detail, and they asked me to wait for 14 days. After 14 days they wrote me that they didn't find my powerbank and cable. Even though they had all the information. They only needed to contact the bus driver, who confirmed she had them.I'm deeply disappointed by this situation. I'll try not to use FlixBus in the future. Buses without power outlets are not convenient at all. But what's most frustrating is their attitude. Of course it's my fault I forgot the powerbank and the cable in the bus. But they had all the information the same day it happened. It could've been solved the next day.

Poor customer service experienced, reconsidering future use of Flix bus service.",5,GB,2024-04-24,Trustpilot
the lack of empathy,"Frustrating cancellation policy. You can only get a voucher, no cash refund. The table of cancellation fees was also very misleading. We cancelled our booking 7 calendar days before our trip, but because we cancelled 1 hour later than the departure time, I was charged for the 6 day cancellation rate. My biggest issue is that my booking still said 7 days away. I think they should be consistent and that the cancellation day should match the booking system. If my trip says ‚Äú7 days away‚Äù in the system, I should get the 7 day cancellation policy.",3,BY,2024-04-24,Trustpilot

Easy Peasy not hard at all,"Nu al een aantal keren met flixbus meegereden en alleen maar positieve ervaringen gehad. Heerlijk rustig en betaalbaar op reis, voor mensen met een kleine beurs is dit ideaal. Natuurlijk kan de bus vertraging oplopen, het verkeer is nu eenmaal druk. Ik heb onlangs wel een heel slechte bus gehad tussen Parijs en Toulouse. Geen stroom/oplaadpunten en toilet en een kapotte rugleuning en tochtige ramen waardoor de rit minder comfortabel was. Het contrast was vooral groot omdat we het eerste deel van onze reis in een nieuwe superdeluxe dubbeldekkerbus zaten.  Na een half uur waren we gewend aan de situatie. Belangrijk is dat we veilig op de bestemming aankwamen. Eerlijkheidshalve moet ik melden dat bij 3 van de 5 ritten/bussen het toilet niet gebruikt kon worden en bij 4 van de 5 ritten de wifi niet werkte (ik vind dat persoonlijk onbelangrijk maar voor mensen die willen werken is dat wellicht onhandig), het is misschien beter om dat op de website aan te kondigen. De chauffeurs zijn altijd aardig, mensen die klagen over het humeur van de chauffeurs moeten even bedenken dat er erg veel gezeurd wordt door passagiers.  De chauffeurs zijn er niet om de passagiers te entertainen, maar om mensen veilig van a naar b te brengen en dat doen ze prima. Ik ben nog van het oude stempel, uit de tijd dat chauffeurs een fooi kregen. Denk ook eens aan deze vorm van waardering als je de bus verlaat ;) ",5,HU,2024-04-23,Trustpilot

Easy and fast,"El d√≠a 8 de Marzo de 2024 tomamos un FlixBus que sali√≥ desde Barcelona hacia Par√≠s a las 21:30 desde la estaci√≥n. La empresa ofrece la opci√≥n de pagar para elegir asientos, pago el cual realizamos con mi pareja para poder tener asientos contiguos y estar tranquilos. Bueno, error, NO PAGUEN POR ELEGIR ASIENTO. Cuando nos subimos el clima era un CAOS ya que la gente se estaba sentado en asientos asignados, en mi caso tambi√©n hab√≠a una persona sentada en mi asiento (el cual, repito, PAGAMOS DE MAS PARA PODER ELEGIR ASIENTO), la cual se neg√≥ a moverse. Al recurrir al chofer, de muy mala manera nos dijo que nos sentemos donde pudi√©ramos porque sino el bus no pod√≠a salir. Entre gritos y peleas, pudimos conseguir que una persona muy amable accediera a moverse de asiento para poder viajar de la manera que hab√≠amos PAGADO. Tambi√©n cabe recalcar que el bus lleg√≥ fuera del horario del billete. P√©sima experiencia, estresante por dem√°s con algo que se podr√≠a haber solucionado tan f√°cil como controlando los billetes y que las personas estuvieran sentadas efectivamente en el lugar que les correspond√≠a.

"Very easy to use website,excellent!","I had a trip with Flixbus from Vienna to Graz. I was at the exact place on the ticket about 20 minutes before the departure. It was an unsuitable and dangerous place for a bus station, so, I kept looking around, but couldn't find the station and missed the bus. After that, I realized that the true station location is 150 meters away from the location they provided on the application. It was a terrible experience on my first visit to Vienna. The worst part was after complaining about the wrong location they just sent me typical answers and did not accept it. I sent them the images and locations of the correct and wrong locations but kept receiving typical responses. They did not even reform the location !!!",5,CA,2024-04-23,Trustpilot

Bad services ,"Truck driver needed to reschedule reservation. Aware that changes needed to be made before reservation time, and I did so! The difference of the ticket amount was charged to my account I received a notification that my account was charged and that the booking had been changed. Had that have been the case it would have been great. I am not able to speak upon the accommodations or the service for the trip because my trip subsequently was canceled after the cutoff time. As well as you shouldn't bother paying the upgrade for selecting your seat because I paid the upgrade and received a message later in the day that they were sorry but my seat selection was not available. Mind you this email message came a substantial amount of time after my booking was made. I have now lost the entire value of my reservation and did not occupy a single inch of the bus. This very much feels like a scam to me. I felt that receiving only 25% refund on the same day reservation was already a ridiculous amount to offer but in the end this company still was able to scam me out of the entire ticket price due to their delay of card processing. I originally paid cash for my reservation which was very impressive as many companies do not offer cash pay as an option for a reservation. Perhaps if I would have paid cash again things would have been okay but I was not in a location where I was able to do so before the cut off deadline. I guess that was a major mistake!

Smooth and convenient!,My overall experience with Flixbus is 4 stars based on ease of booking and frequency of daily departures to and from my destinations.  The unpredictability of delays and cancelation of trips prevents me from giving 5 stars. A couple of times cancelations of trips or extreme delay put in in a bind. But overall I  am satisfied with the service.,4,DE,2024-04-18,Trustpilot

That was true they were either on time or 1 minute late.The driver started saying that they were arguing with her and then told them to speak English since we only speak English in the US. Now they actually spoke pretty good English. And they were actually being respectful to the driver. But then driver actually said ""We don't speak Enchiladan here in the US."" At that point the driver was laughing and left them at the stop. The driver immediately called her friend on the phone and was laughing saying that was the last bus of the day!

The bus is also very comfortable, which I consider essential for long trips. Nevertheless, I'd like to point out one detail for which I won't rate it 5 stars: The USB devices on the seats didn't work well for everyone on the bus; the USB ports were loose, so the cables wouldn't connect properly.

Their website/android app gives jack sh. updates and their livechat is a fake box no one replied to me in 20 minutes while I was asking for an update. I was not refunded because ""The bus came and other passengers got on board"" as if that somehow makes all these facts ""OK"" . Late bus is not ok. Lack of information and support is not ok. Refusing a refund considering you messed up and the above, not ok. Enjoy your 8 euros you big noses I will avoid giving you any more if I can help and you will eventually be buried and bought by someone better since you're bleeding money by not caring about your customers.For other users on here, I recommend you check into local bus companies in the country/city you travel, flix bus is a disappointment and while you may get lucky and find a good ride, think about if you wanna take that chance and have a Plan B at the back of your mind.",3,MT,2024-04-13,Trustpilot

Great company,"One of the most frustrating experiences I‚Äôve dealt with. I was supposed to take the Flix bus from Bilbao to Porto on the 15th of March 2024, at 11:20 pm. I was at the station since 10:30 pm waiting for the bus‚Äôs arrival. Usually the gates the buses arrive from are mentioned on the main screen, for some reason, there was no mention of any gate for the bus to Porto. I was travelling with 2 friends of mine and we kept waiting until eventually after the time of the bus‚Äôs departure and the bus was nowhere to be seen. We looked throughout the station around that time multiple times and there was no Flix Bus in the station whatsoever. It was mentioned that it was delayed until 11:29 pm, but still no show. Multiple hours eventually passed and I called Flix Bus customer service, they claimed that the bus came and left, nevertheless, it never came in the station. There were two other passengers apart from our group who also claim to not have seen the bus and hence missed out on their trip. To make matters worse, we had checked the tracker on the bus and it said that multiple hours after its scheduled departure, the bus was actually on its way from Porto to Bilbao, which made no sense whatsoever. A few hours later, it made a detour and went on its way back to Porto (Bus N1137), and we were all left in extreme confusion. I filed for a refund and the company is unwilling to give me the full refund back because they claim I missed the bus, which is not the case, the bus did not come. I responded to the email again and they replied again with the same automated email of saying ‚Äú We're sorry to hear you missed your ride from Bilbao to Porto on Mar 15, 2024 and we can imagine how frustrating this situation must've been for you.‚Äù a similar copy of the initial mail, showing their lack of concern and care for their customers. I would like to state that this information can be backed by numerous other witnesses in the Bilbao bus station. I would never recommend this company, and I will always tell others of this experience if they ask me about Flix Bus, showing no care for its customers. A true corporate shame.

"It easy to book,",Bus was late to arrive at destination (more than 2.5 hours late). It was caused by the company's lack of maintenance of the buses. Bus had to stop at a depot for 2 hours to change flat tyres. Tried to ask for a partial refund/compensation but was denied (even though tickets were expensive for a Washington DC-NYC bus return trip). Customers should be entitled for refunds/compensations for delays caused by Flixbus. Heavily do not recommend this bus service for other travellers.

Imagine my surprise when the bus driver only allowed one person to get on, so me and one other passenger was left without any reasonable explanation on why we couldn't board the bus. My idea is that as bus was going with a stop at an airport the driver thought sat it a good idea to get passengers from side, while taking one person to cover him self. After a long conversation with customer support, I was informed that  it isn't their fault, one person was able to get on the bus and it wasn't delayed so there is nothing they could do. I highly recommend one not to use services of this company, especially if you travel internationally,  as you can be left abandoned.",5,US,2024-04-10,Trustpilot

Lately constantly changing seats, punctuality is not what it once was ( whilst I understand that on some longer trips it is complicated to predict traffic and eventuakl inconveniences ), I recently used the service for a trip to Lyon from Turin, due to a landslide in the Alps the route was changed and hence a two hour plus difference in arrival time causing me to miss an appointment, even though I contacted the customer service prior to departure I was assured the service was running as usual, the driver was fully aware that the route would be different and had made the trips several times therefore the company were also well aware of the issue, although I contacted customer services to express my disappointment I received no reply or compensation for the inconvenience completely cancelling trips at short notice ( return trip from Munich in Germany was totally cancelled several hours before departure after having made the outbound journey ), this is a general opinion and not solely related to the last trip.",5,US,2024-04-10,Trustpilot

Super easy to use,"Was not allowed to sit in my pre-paid, pre-assigned upgrad d seat becaus driver was using it for his colleagues. I was told to sit elsewhere, which ended up being someone else's assign seat, which created conflict. Driver allowed colleagues to play loud music, talk loudly, and smoke on the bus. It was very unprofessional and incredibly annoying. There was no restroom on the bus, even though it was advertised as having one, and for a 15 hour trip we're only afford 1 10 minute bathroom break. When I asked for the bus to wait for me while I used the restroom at an undesignated stop, I was made to feel as if I was holding the bus up. I was told five minutes only so I rushed. When I returned, we sat there for at least another 10-15 minutes while the driver finishes smoking and chatting. He knew I had more time the 5 minutes and was just being an ass. Overall, it was a terrible trip that I will not do again.------March 29, 2024After posting the original review on March 15th, FlixBus did reimburse me for the upgraded seats I was denied.

Within line of course of past action, she gave out some tentative time that the bus will supposedly come in 150 minutes from the original time of departure. At that point, I had lost all trust with the company and asked for a refund. To my even greater surprise, the refund is not in full. You only are refunded the fare but not the booking fee, which accounts for 30 percent of the total price I paid. If your bus arrive on time, then all is good with flix.

Bus was very clean,"FlixBus Eslov√°quia x Busapest- diferentemente da viagem de Viena √† Eslov√°quia, onde o motorista, al√©m de falar ingl√™s, ele era gentil e educado ao falar com os passageiros que lhe perguntavam algo. - - No caso atual (viagem da Eslov√°quia x Budapest), haviam 2 motoristas. Um mais grosseiro e mal educado do que o outro. - * levando em conta que pouqu√≠ssimas pessoas falam esloveno, o mais √≥bvio e minimamente apropriado seria que ao menos um deles falassem ingl√™s. * neste caso, um dirigiu por todo o trajeto, ouvindo a sua pr√≥pria colet√¢nea musical. Onde todos os passageiros, foram obrigados a ouvir as m√∫sicas eslovenas que o motorista, n√£o contente em ouvir suas m√∫sicas preferidas, ela aumentava a cada uma delas que mais gostava. Eu, que sofro de fibromialgia, estava com uma dor de cabe√ßa enorme e estava contando com o sil√™ncio do trajeto, para que a dor pudesse passar ao menos um pouco. Mas n√£o teve jeito. Cada vez que tocava uma m√∫sica que ele gostava, ele aumentava mais ainda o volume.* uma passageira foi at√© o outro motorista (que n√£o estava dirigindo) e por 3 vezes consecutivas, perguntou se o WC, estava funcionando e ele falou ‚Äúalgo‚Äù com o que estava na dire√ß√£o e simplesmente a ignorou. Na 3‚Äôx que ela insistiu, o motorista nem se dignou a olhar pra ela. Simplesmente balan√ßou a cabe√ßa (aparentemente querendo dizer que o WC, n√£o estava funcionando). * Tentei fazer a internet funcionar algumas vezes, mas sem sucesso, infelizmente tive que me direcionar √† ele (2‚Äô motorista), onde ele simplesmente balan√ßou a cabe√ßa (querendo dar entender, que n√£o!)* vale dizer que este 2‚Äô motorista (que n√£o dirigia), passou a viagem toda com o p√© em cima da ‚Äúmesinha‚Äù que fica entre a cadeira 1 (dita por ele mesmo ‚Äúcadeira do motorista‚Äù). * Para finalizar, com 30min √† finalizar a viagem, este 2‚Äômotorista, desceu e se colocou ao lado do que estava dirigindo. Ficaram conversando alto pra finalizar, ainda aumentou um pouco mais a altura da m√∫sica e ficou cantando junto! * Veina X Bratislava * s√≥ elogios qto ao motorista. Primeiramente o melhor ponto positivo √© que ele falava ingl√™s. Isto sem dizer, que foi gentil, prestativo e simp√°tico. Nos ajudou com d√∫vidas que t√≠nhamos em rela√ß√£o de onde descer. Pois como foi a nossa primeira vez na Eslov√™nia, e n√£o falando a l√≠ngua, n√≥s ir√≠amos facilmente descer na 1‚Äô parada que o √¥nibus fez. Que na verdade, nada mais era do que (para nos), no meio do nada, onde ter√≠amos descido com 2 malas sem termos o que fazer com as malas, etc. * Qdo eu perguntei para ele, se haveria uma outra esta√ß√£o üöâ e se ele saberia de um lugar onde eu pudesse deixar as malas em um (guarda malas), ele foi extremamente gentil e nos explicou onde dever√≠amos descer, onde poder√≠amos deixar as malas, etc* Mesmo sendo uma viajem muito curta, n√£o poderia deixar de elogiar a forma que ele dirigiu. Deixando a todos os passageiros muito confort√°veis e seguros.* ponto negativo * O WC, n√£o estava apenas sujo e sim imundo e NOJENTO. N√£o s√≥ de res√≠duos de urina.

P√ºnktliche Abfahrt und Ankunft.,"Hello,Unfortunately, our first journey with FlixBus, which we took with my son, ended in disaster. At our initial boarding point, an aggressive driver who didn't speak English charged us money despite having two people and one piece of not heavy luggage. When we requested a receipt, he became even more aggressive, speaking in German and refusing to provide one. The assistant, who was supposed to help us with our luggage, also displayed the same aggression while loading our suitcase onto the bus. When we asked for a delivery receipt, she reacted strangely and refused to provide it, making communication impossible. Both staff members were incredibly rude and did not reflect well on FlixBus.Unfortunately, it started off very poorly; there was a lot of shaking on the upper floor, and the journey from Munich to Sofia was uncomfortable due to a locked toilet, despite specifically choosing a bus with a toilet in the reservation. We couldn't use the toilet throughout the journey, leading to health problems and extremely difficult situations that I won't go into detail about.We were not satisfied at all with this journey turned into torture. We request a refund for the service we did not receive.Best regards.Hello again,It's quite evident that customer service didn't bother to read my detailed complaint; they simply replied with a standard message and offered a 20% discount for the next FlixBus trip. This must be a joke. I will never travel with FlixBus again; it's nothing but regret. My advice is to definitely avoid traveling with this company. Take a train, a plane, or even walk, but never board a FlixBus. During my recent trip from Munich to Sofia, there was a strong smell of cigarettes coming from the front of the bus. I don't know if the driver or any passenger was smoking, but I certainly didn't receive the service I paid for.",3,US,2024-03-26,Trustpilot

El trato muy amable y bus c√≥modo.,"On March 23, 2024, my daughter and I were returning from Warsaw to Lodz. I paid for tickets for the ride at 16-40 in advance. We arrived at Warsaw Zachodnia station at 16-20 and looked for a platform where our bus could be located. The app showed platforms 2, 8,9, 11-13.How difficult is it to indicate one correct platform number and update this data in the application?!!! The information at the bus station was only on rain-soaked pieces of paper glued to the poles. We asked drivers and other passengers, but there was no bus and there was no information about it. Online tracking for this route was not working. Contacting company representatives through the application is extremely inconvenient. Several other passengers were looking for this bus with us. The bus never showed up.As a result, we had to buy new tickets for the next nearest ride. In the support chat, in which they finally responded to me, they refused to refund me and the operator wrote that the bus arrived on time at platform 21. There is no platform 21 at the Warsaw Zachodnia bus station!This is a mockery of customers, not service! I will always avoid Flixbus.

Excellent service,"Loved my ride from Lagos to Lisbon so much I paid extra to get on the flex bus to Porto for the airport home .I bought a seat because I had to get that bus . There was a Rede bus for less money and the exact same timing and route. But I chose flex as I knew it had wifi and electric outlets. I actually paid more money than riding with Rede!I placed my luggage in the hold. Then checked with the driver that it was the correct bus. He said no. So I took my luggage off and waited for the next bus as I was told by that same driver that it was the correct bus.I waited for the next bus. The bus that I was going to board was getting full and it was soon time for that bus to depart. I checked with the driver again and he checked his list and found my name and declared that this was the bus.I reloaded my luggage, found my seat, plugged in my phone which I desperately needed charging.It didn‚Äôt work.  I approached the driver who said he didn‚Äôt know. I was advised by other passengers to try another port. I did this several time and they didn‚Äôt work either! I was frustrated, annoyed and exhausted and needed my phone to make the final arrangements for my hotel that evening. The man beside me assume that the wifi wasn‚Äôt working either.  I turned my phone off and hoped for the best.  It was a difficult end to a wonderful three weeks in Portugal. My seat was ragged and torn with much wear. This was obviously an old bus they were failing to maintain but used anyway.The only good thing about the voyage was the niceness of the man who sat beside me. I think I would choose the rede bus line for future travels. I‚Äôm planning on going back to Portugal one day. Would a credit or refund be too much to ask for the extra money I paid and for the aggravation that I withstood?",5,TR,2024-03-25,Trustpilot

From a 22 hours plan it grew up to 29 hours. From one stop it transformed to 4 stops, one in Bayonne where the was nothing but a street bus stop near a river, and where I had to stay 4 hours. I was supposed to take 2 buses, I traveled on 5 buses. Surprising! Not good or bad, just quite inexpected.",5,PT,2024-03-25,Trustpilot

They provided us another bus to finish the trip. You have to listen carefully, as there is no PA system in the bus, so when the driver announces the stops, or anything important, it‚Äôs really difficult to hear, when you are really far back on the bus. Unfortunately, the Wi-Fi did not have an Internet connection for the trip. ",5,ES,2024-03-25,Trustpilot
My experience went about 1 time,"I paid extra to reserve 2 seats next to each other. When we arrived the guys from flix wanted everybody on the dubbeldeckerbus on the ""second floor"" while the bottom floor was empty and our seatnumbers were there. We had to sit next to strangers. He said he didnt care about seatnumbers or the reservations. We had such a bad experience that although we reservered and paid for the way back to Rotterdam as well we didnt want to be on the flixbus anymore and took the train. Way more expensive but better than this ripoff.. never again for us.",5,CA,2024-03-25,Trustpilot
